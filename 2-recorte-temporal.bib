abstract={Recent studies have shown that children with autism may be interested in playing with an interactive robot. Moreover, the robot can engage these children in ways that demonstrate essential aspects of human interaction, guiding them in therapeutic sessions to practice more complex forms of interaction found in social human-to-human interactions. We review published articles on robot-assisted autism therapy (RAAT) to understand the trends in research on this type of therapy for children with autism and to provide practitioners and researchers with insights and possible future directions in the field. Specifically, we analyze 38 articles, all of which are refereed journal articles, that were indexed on Web of Science from 2009 onward, and discuss the distribution of the articles by publication year, article type, database and journal, research field, robot type, participant age range, and target behaviors. Overall, the results show considerable growth in the number of journal publications on RAAT, reflecting increased interest in the use of robot technology in autism therapy as a salient and legitimate research area. Factors, such as new advances in artificial intelligence techniques and machine learning, have spurred this growth. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The benefits of user-centered and participatory design have been widely acknowledged for the development of technologies that are likely to be appropriated by the product's stakeholders. While participatory design has been applied to some affective technologies, the technical and algorithmic complexity of those based on semi-intelligent information filters (SIIFs) pose distinct challenges. Coincidentally, these technologies raise important and distinct ethical issues that make stakeholder input critical during product design. We present a framework for fostering genuine engagement from stakeholders through the case example of biomusic - a SIIF-based affective technology that translates emotion-related physiological changes into sound. During a 3-day workshop, ethnographic methods were used to collect data about the interface between biomusic and individuals on the autism spectrum. From these data, emergent themes, such as such as privacy, data security, conceptions of assistive technology and representation of emotions were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. In order to illuminate distinct design decisions implicated by these complex and interwoven ethical issues, we propose a design framework consisting of a technological, a human-centered and an ecological lens. This framework and recommendations provide a concrete praxis for engaging stakeholders in the complex issues associated with the design of SIIF-based emotion-oriented systems. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={With the rising prevalence of autism diagnoses, it is essential for research to understand how to leverage technology to support the diverse nature of autistic traits. While traditional interventions focused on technology for medical cure and rehabilitation, recent research aims to understand how technology can accommodate each unique situation in an efficient and engaging way. Extended reality (XR) technology has been shown to be effective in improving attention in autistic users given that it is more engaging and motivating than other traditional mediums. Here, we conducted a systematic review of 59 research articles that explored the role of attention in XR interventions for autistic users. We systematically analyzed demographics, study design and findings, including autism screening and attention measurement methods. Furthermore, given methodological inconsistencies in the literature, we systematically synthesize methods and protocols including screening tools, physiological and behavioral cues of autism and XR tasks. While there is substantial evidence for the effectiveness of using XR in attention-based interventions for autism to support autistic traits, we have identified three principal research gaps that provide promising research directions to examine how autistic populations interact with XR. First, our findings highlight the disproportionate geographic locations of autism studies and underrepresentation of autistic adults, evidence of gender disparity, and presence of individuals diagnosed with co-occurring conditions across studies. Second, many studies used an assortment of standardized and novel tasks and self-report assessments with limited tested reliability. Lastly, the research lacks evidence of performance maintenance and transferability. Based on these challenges, this paper discusses inclusive future research directions considering greater diversification of participant recruitment, robust objective evaluations using physiological measurements (e.g., eye-tracking), and follow-up maintenance sessions that promote transferrable skills. Pursuing these opportunities would lead to more effective therapy solutions, improved accessible interfaces, and engaging interactions. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={COVID-19 has posed new physical and mental challenges for the population worldwide, establishing social and structural changes in the labor market that could be maintained and im-plemented permanently. This new reality will require new strategies to improve family and work conciliation, which is especially challenging for families with children suffering from psychological pathologies such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These changes have led to more frequent and intense behavioral problems, causing stress, anxiety, and confusion for these children and their families. Thus, the need to have tools that help parents reconcile work with the care of these children, who have low autonomy, is reinforced. This work develops a method for the design of assistive technology and smart products to support children with ASD in following a routine and managing tasks autonomously. In this way, the article analyzes the design problem including the needs and preferences of children with ASD and their parents during confinement in terms of dependence and adaptability; develops a design method for interactive and smart products focused on children with ASD in confinement situations; and validates this method in a case study, in which a robot is developed that makes it easier for children with ASD to follow a routine. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Social interactions significantly impact the quality of life for people with special needs (e.g., older adults with dementia and children with autism). They may suffer loneliness and social isolation more often than people without disabilities. There is a growing demand for technologies to satisfy the social needs of such user groups. However, evaluating these systems can be challeng-ing due to the extra difficulty of gathering data from people with special needs (e.g., communication barriers involving older adults with dementia and children with autism). Thus, in this systematic review, we focus on studying data gathering methods for evaluating socially assistive systems (SAS). Six academic databases (i.e., Scopus, Web of Science, ACM, Science Direct, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore) were searched, covering articles published from January 2000 to July 2021. A total of 65 articles met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. The results showed that existing SASs most often targeted people with visual impairments, older adults, and children with autism. For instance, a common type of SASs aimed to help blind people perceive social signals (e.g., facial expressions). SASs were most commonly assessed with interviews, questionnaires, and observation data. Around half of the interview studies only involved target users, while the other half also in-cluded secondary users or stakeholders. Questionnaires were mostly used with older adults and people with visual impairments to measure their social interaction, emotional state, and system us-ability. A great majority of observational studies were carried out with users in special age groups, especially older adults and children with autism. We thereby contribute an overview of how different data gathering methods were used with various target users of SASs. Relevant insights are ex-tracted to inform future development and research. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Background: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often exhibit difficulties in social and communication skills. For more than 30 years, specialists, parents, and caregivers have used techniques, such as applied behavioral analysis, augmentative and alternative communication, and the picture exchange communication system to support the social and communication skills of people with ASD. Even though there are many techniques devised to enhance communication, these techniques are not considered in existing social media apps for people with ASD. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effect of adding accessibility features, such as text-to-speech (TTS), speech-to-text (STT), and communication symbols (CS), to a messaging app (MAAN). We hypothesized that these accessibility features can enhance the social and communication skills of adults with ASD. We also hypothesized that usage of this app can reduce social loneliness in adults with ASD. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 5 experts working in fields related to ASD to help design the app. Seven adults with ASD participated in the study for a period of 10 to 16 weeks. Data logs of participants’ interactions with the app were collected. Additionally, 6 participants’ parents and 1 caregiver were asked to complete a short version of the Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults (SELSA-S) questionnaire to compare pre-post study results. The Mobile Application Rating Scale: user version questionnaire was also used to evaluate the app’s usability. Following the study, interviews were conducted with participants to discuss their experiences with the app. Results: The SELSA-S questionnaire results showed no change in the family subscale; however, the social loneliness subscale showed a difference between prestudy and poststudy. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated that poststudy SELSA-S results were statistically significantly higher than prestudy results (z=-2.047; P=.04). Point-biserial correlation indicated that the SELSA-S rate of change was strongly related to usage of the TTS feature (r=0.708; P=.04) and CS feature (r=-0.917; P=.002), and moderately related to usage of the STT feature (r=0.428; P=.17). Lastly, we adopted grounded theory to analyze the interview data, and the following 5 categories emerged: app support, feature relevance, user interface design, overall feedback, and recommendations. Conclusions: This study discusses the potential for improving the communication skills of adults with ASD through special features in mobile messaging apps. The developed app aims to support the inclusion and independent life of adults with ASD. The study results showed the importance of using TTS, STT, and CS features to enhance social and communication skills, as well as reduce social loneliness in adults with ASD. © Mohamad Hassan Fadi Hijab, Dena Al-Thani, Bilikis Banire.},

abstract={Advances in the areas of face and gesture analysis, computational paralinguistics, multimodal interaction, and human-computer interaction have all played a major role in shaping research into assistive technologies over the last decade. This has resulted in a breadth of practical applications ranging from diagnosis and treatment tools to social companion technologies. From an analytical perspective, nonverbal cues provide understanding into the assessment of mental health and wellbeing (i.e., detecting depression and pain) and the detection of developmental and neurological conditions such as autism, dementia, and schizophrenia. From both a synthesis and generative perspective, it is necessary that assistive technologies, either disembodied or embodied, are capable of generating engaging, interactive behaviours and interventions that are personalised and adapted to user's needs, profiles, and preferences. While nonverbal cues play an essential role, there are still many key issues to overcome, which affect both the development and the deployment of multimodal technologies in real-world settings. The key aim of this multidisciplinary workshop is to foster cross-pollination by bringing together computer scientists and social psychologists to discuss innovative ideas, challenges and opportunities for understanding and generating multimodal nonverbal cues within the scope of healthcare applications1. © 2021 Owner/Author.},

In addition, school librarians have requirements under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (2004) to support students they serve in their setting. While professional librarians are prepared for their field through high-quality accredited programs, very few programs provide coursework specific to individuals with disabilities and even fewer with any coursework in the area of ASD. This study utilized content analysis to review 90 librarian preparation programs yielding only five course syllabi from four universities that include courses in supporting individuals with disabilities. Only two of the five courses reviewed included information about individuals with ASD specifically.

abstract={The majority of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have faced difficulties in sensory processing, which affect their ability of effective attention and stress management. Children with ASD also have unique patterns of sensory processing when responding to the stimuli in the environment. In this study, a real-time monitoring system has been designed and developed for attention and stress detection. Comprehensive sensory information, including environmental, physiological, and sensory profile data can be collected by the system using sensors, smart devices, and a standard sensory profiling questionnaire. Data acquisition with 35 ASD children using the system prototype was successfully conducted. With the acquired data set, different machine learning models were trained to predict attentional and stress level. Among all the investigated models, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree and Random Forest obtained the best prediction accuracies of 86.67% and 99.05% on attention and stress detection respectively. The two models were then implemented into the system for automatic detection. Future work could be focusing on exploring more supportive features to improve the prediction accuracy for attention detection. Such an easily-accessed monitoring system tailored for children with ASD could be widely-used in daily life to assist ASD users with their attention and stress management. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnoses increased over the last decades, as reviews show comparing prevalence rates reported from different studies. Due to different effects of the disorder, personal support is required and provided by formal and/or informal caregivers in various activities of daily living. With the help of a customized smart home and interior design concept the aim is to enable people with ASD to live a more independent and self-reliant life. Following a participatory research approach, the end users are involved in the context of use and requirements definition, concept development, and later also in the implementation, and evaluation process. The solution shall assist end users in performing activities of daily living. The outcome of the work at hand is a set of modular functionalities (sensors, actuators, interior design solutions) to be integrated in a living environment specifically designed for people with ASD. © 2021 The authors, AIT Austrian Institute of Technology and IOS Press.},

It has been serving as a successful assistive technology for several disordered conditions. Children with neuro developmental disorders have the inadequacy to learn new things or adapt to changes in the environment. Although, there are various conventional techniques like flashcards, blackboard, parental care etc., available to train such children, VR has been found to bring promising outcomes in terms of behavior and learning. In this study, different virtual environments have been developed and experimented with a sample group of normal and autistic children to test the cognitive learning ability. Correspondingly, EEG signal acquisition and evaluation has been performed which showed significant improvement in their cognitive learning ability during VR therapy. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The development of digital supports for people with autism has increased considerably in recent years. Technology designers and developers have interpreted the needs and learning styles of people with autism in different ways. As a result, there are generic, non-specific or heterogeneous guidelines for the design and development of technology for people with autism. This study aims to identify and describe the recommended elements to support graphical user interface design for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), considering the stakeholders’ perspective, engaged in a computer application development. A qualitative, longitudinal, multicentre study was carried out. A sample of 39 participants belonging to four groups of stakeholders participated: children with autism, family members, professionals with experience in the intervention with children with autism, and professionals with expertise in the design and development of assistive technology. The techniques used to formalise the collection of information from participants were semi-structured interviews and observation. MAXQDA 2020 software (Verbi Software, Berlin, Germany) was used to analyse the data. The result is a guide with suggestions to support an interface design that emerges from the stakeholder perspectives. This study provides useful information to offer alternatives for children with ASD and facilitate the understanding of daily life. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Children with a visual impairment experience lower psychological well-being than normative populations. While research on this subject is abundant, an overview is lacking of the methods used and topics commonly studied, to guide future research. The aim was to provide a visual overview of common topics included in psychological well-being research from 2000 to 2018 among children with a visual impairment. We created a bibliometric map with the VOSviewer programme using the text mining functionality to construct and visualise co-occurrences of relevant terms from the titles and abstracts in the included literature. The results show that common subjective terms are behaviour, relationships, attachment and parenting, cerebral visual impairment, cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability. The common methodological terms include literature and randomized control trials, with the latter restricted to specific terms such as parenting. The conclusions and implications are that the results give insight into the subject terms studied in past years and provide a roadmap for future research in the fields of visual impairment and psychological well-being of children. The topics needing more research are rare disorders, siblings, assistive technology, romantic relationships, bullying, and the frequent cooccurrences of visual impairment with autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={The present research evaluates the effectiveness of CymaSense, a real-time 3D visualisation application developed by the authors, as a means of improving the communicative behaviours of autistic participants through the addition of a visual modality within therapeutic music sessions. Autism spectrum condition (ASC) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder that can affect people in a number of ways, commonly through difficulties in communication. A multi-sensory approach within music sessions encourages people with ASC to engage more with the act of creating music, and with the therapists, increasing their level of communication and social interaction beyond the sessions. This article presents a study evaluating the use of CymaSense within a series of therapeutic music sessions, and a follow-up series of semi-structured interviews. Eight adults with ASC participated in 12 sessions using a single case experimental design approach over a total period of 19 weeks. Using qualitative and quantitative data, the results show an increase in communicative behaviour, for both verbal and non-verbal participants, resulting from the use of CymaSense. Qualitative feedback from interviews provided insight into the factors that contribute to the successful use of the application, as well as aspects that could be improved. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={The percentage of people around the world who are living with some kind of disability or disorder has increased in recent years and continues to rise due to the aging of the population and the increase in chronic health disorders. People with disabilities find problems in performing some of the activities of daily life, such as working, attending school, or participating in social and recreational events. Neurological disorders such as epilepsy, learning disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, or Alzheimer’s, are among the main diseases that affect a large number of this population. However, thanks to the assistive technologies (AT), these people can improve their performance in some of the obstacles presented by their disorders. This paper presents a new system that aims to help people with neurological disorders providing useful information about their pathologies. This novelty system consists of a platform where the physiological and environmental data acquisition, the feature engineering, and the machine learning algorithms are combined to generate customs predictive models that help the user. Finally, to demonstrate the use of the system and the working methodology employed in the platform, a simple example case is presented. This example case carries out an experimentation that presents a user without neurological problems that shows the versatility of the platform and validates that it is possible to get useful information that can feed an intelligent algorithm. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Children on the autism spectrum (AS) often struggle with writing tasks at school. They commonly experience difficulty with two key aspects of writing: the skills required for handwriting (fine motor and perceptual) and the conceptual and language skills required for written composition. Specialist intervention to assist with written expression is, therefore, often needed for students on the AS to succeed academically. This research evaluated the impact of using self-regulated strategy development (SRSD) in combination with assistive technology on the quality and length of written compositions of students on the AS. It also investigated how students felt about using the SRSD writing strategy. Eight primary school students on the AS between the ages of 9 and 12 participated in this single-subject study. An ABAC study design was used to evaluate student writing performance across three conditions. Baseline handwriting measurements were collected during condition A. During condition B students used assistive technology alone; in condition C, students applied their understanding of SRSD while using assistive technology. Results from this study show that, in many cases, the quality and/or length of written compositions and feelings of self-efficacy towards persuasive writing of students on the AS improved when they received physical and/or conceptual writing supports. This paper presents the research design, methods and results from this single-subject study followed by a discussion of the results and final thoughts and areas for future research. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic? There is limited research about how the persuasive writing of students on the autism spectrum (AS) can be supported in a socially inclusive way. Research has shown that the use of assistive technologies like keyboards and writing-support software can improve the writing outcomes of students on the AS. Research has shown that the use of self-regulated strategy development (SRSD) writing strategies can improve the persuasive writing outcomes of diverse students. What this paper adds? A single-subject study using an ABAC study design showed that persuasive writing outcomes improved in quality or length for some students when they used an app that combined the two strategies. Implications for policy and practice SRSD combined with writing-support software appeared to improve the writing outcomes of some students on the AS. It can, therefore, be used as a tool to support teachers in developing strategies for inclusive classrooms. © 2021 British Educational Research Association},

abstract={Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have some disturbance activities. Usually, they cannot speak fluently. Instead, they use gestures and pointing words to make a relationship. Hence, understanding their needs is one of the most challenging tasks for caregivers, but early diagnosis of the disease can make it much easier. The lack of verbal and nonverbal communications can be eliminated by assistive technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT-based systems help to diagnose and improve the patients’ lives through applying Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. This paper provides a systematic review of the ASD approaches in the context of IoT devices. The main goal of this review is to recognize significant research trends in the field of IoT-based healthcare. Also, a technical taxonomy is presented to classify the existing papers on the ASD methods and algorithms. A statistical and functional analysis of reviewed ASD approaches is provided based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy and sensitivity. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The aim of this article is to examine the opportunities for employees with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), arising from digital technology (DT) development. The author discusses assistive technology (AT) as a mean of creating a better work environment, making the digitized workplace more friendly for people with ASD. A possible solution of communication problems is replacing the interpersonal communication between employees with electronic (non-direct) forms of communication, such as online communicators or chatbots. Another solution is the implementation of wearable electronic systems, monitoring stress levels and facilitating effective stress control. In the future, the whole digitized workplace could be designed according to a “smart workplace” concept. Sensors recording various human body parameters could be connected to a network with sensors recording physical parameters of the work environment (temperature, humidity, noise, smell, sunlight exposure) and also with controllers of its values, adjusting it dynamically to reduce distracting factors. As a result, communication, stress management, and sensory sensitiveness problems could be limited, improving the work comfort of people with ASD, and their colleagues. The pertinence of solutions proposed was also confirmed by the experts interviewed in the field who were asked to assess it in the context of future implementation. © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2020.},

abstract={Although Sweden is one of the most digitalized countries and the Swedish population’s use of the internet is among the most studied in the world, little is known about how Swedes with disabilities use internet. The purpose of this study is to describe use of and perceived difficulties in use of the internet among people with disabilities and to explore digital divides in-between and within disability groups, and in comparison with the general population. This is a cross-sectional survey targeting the same issues as other nationwide surveys but adapted for people with cognitive disabilities. Participants were recruited from May to October 2017 by adaptive snowball sampling. The survey comprised questions on access to and use of devices, and use of and perceived difficulties in use of internet. A total of 771 people responded to the survey, representing 35 diagnoses/impairments. Larger proportions of people with autism, ADHD and bipolar disorder reported using internet than other disability groups. Women with autism used the internet more than any other disability group, and women with aphasia used the internet the least. People with disabilities related to language and understanding reported more difficulties using internet than other disability groups. Larger proportions of participants than the general Swedish population reported not feeling digitally included. In many but not all disability groups, larger proportions of men than women reported not feeling digitally included. Our findings show that there are differences in digital inclusion between sub-groups of diagnoses/impairments. Thus, disability digital divides are preferably investigated by sub-grouping disabilities, rather than studied as one homogeneous group. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Purpose: A substantial number of models have been developed over the years, with the purpose of describing the information seeking and searching of people in various user groups and contexts. Several models have been frequently applied in user studies, but are rarely included in research on participants with impairments. Models are purposeful when developing theories. Consequently, it might be valuable to apply models when studying this user group, as well. The purpose of this study was to explore whether existing models are applicable in describing the online information seeking and searching of users with impairments, with an overall aim to increase the use of models in studies involving impairments. Design/methodology/approach: Six models were selected according to the following criteria: the model should address information seeking or searching, include the interaction between users and systems whilst incorporating assistive technology. Two user groups were selected from each of the categories: cognitive, sensory and motor impairments, namely dyslexia, autism, blindness, deafness, paralysation and Parkinson's. The models were then analysed based on known barriers reported for these cohorts. Findings: All the selected models had potential to be applied in user studies involving impairments. While three of the models had the highest potential to be used in the current form, the other three models were applicable either through minor revisions or by combining models. Originality/value: This study contributes with a new perspective on the use of models in information seeking and searching research on users with impairments. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

A cross-sectional survey was administered to adolescents with disability and to parents of disabled children to describe their experience during lockdown and their concerns or expectations about rehabilitation. A sample of 53 adolescents and 239 parents completed the survey. Adolescents were ages 13–18 years old (45.3% female). Most parents were between 35 and 55 years old (84.9% female). While 53.6% of the parents reported no positive effects of the lockdown, 92.5% of the adolescents expressed favorable consequences. The increased time spent with family members was judged positively by 27.2% of parents and by 64.2% of adolescents. Concern for their child’s disability was expressed by 47.3% of parents, while 73.6% of adolescents expressed concerns regarding the ban on meeting friends. In both groups, anxiety symptoms were correlated with the fear of contracting COVID-19 and with financial problems. Parents would have liked even more remote support from school and healthcare professionals, which was available for most participants. Thus, socioeconomic support, assistive technology and telerehabilitation strategies might help families with disabilities during a lockdown. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The study refers to the social aspect of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and focuses on pro-social behaviour that has a positive effect on social adaptability. The first goal of the study was to determine whether there is a gap in prosocial-behaviour between children with High-Functioning ASD (HFASD) and children with typical-development; and secondly, to foster prosocial-behaviour with a computer-mediated intervention versus a non-computer-mediated intervention. The study comprises 58 preschool children, divided into three groups: HFASD experiencing a computer-mediated intervention, HFASD experiencing a non-computer-mediated intervention, and typically-developing children with no intervention. The 2-month intervention was based on the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy model, and pairs of children learned how to solve social-problems. Following preliminary screening tests (PPVT; SCQ), observations designed to evaluate prosocial-ability and Vineland questionnaires measuring prosocial-behaviour were conducted pre- and post-intervention. Pre-intervention findings indicated that children with typical-development exhibited higher prosocial-behaviour than children with HFASD. This changed however, post-intervention, as the gap between the two groups decreased. Additionally, the study found that the computer-mediated intervention group improved in some prosocial measures compared to the non-computer-mediated intervention. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Assistive technologies have the potential to provide accessible support to people with varying needs and abilities, including older autistic adults. However, there is currently limited knowledge about how older autistic adults use technology in their daily lives, whether it is sufficient to meet their needs and whether they experience any barriers to technology use. To address these questions, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 autistic adults aged over 50 years. Using thematic analysis, we identified two major themes related to how older autistic adults use technology: ‘Helping to Manage the External Environment’ and ‘Increasing Everyday Accessibility and Convenience’. Overall, participants reported experiencing a number of challenges associated with performing everyday activities and while technology was able to offer some assistance, a number of gaps still remain in meeting the support needs of this population. Based on these findings, we offer some guidelines and recommendations for technology use with this population to guide future research and practice. Lay abstract: Technology has the potential to help people with various support needs live more autonomous lives. This includes autistic individuals. In this article, we look at how older autistic adults use technology in their daily lives. Past research examining technology use and autism has mainly focused on helping children to learn new skills. To date, very little research has been conducted looking at how to create and design technology for use by older autistic adults. This is concerning because older autistic adults will likely have supports needs that match or exceed those of similarly aged non-autistic individuals. In this article, we spoke to autistic adults over 50 years about their daily experiences and how they use technology. We identified some important ways that older autistic adults use technology in their daily lives, as well as a number of support needs and barriers to technology use. Based on the findings, we were able to provide some guidelines and recommendations for technology developers and service providers to assist with designing, creating and using technology with older autistic adults. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={Introduction: Austism spectrum disorder (ASD) heterogeneity requires these individuals to have functional heterogeneity. Compared to the general population, numerous studies have shown that people with ASD have a lower functional status in performing daily activities and most of them require assistive technology. Methodology: We performed a comparative analysis of the collected data from 72 subjects with ASD and 75 neurotypical controls aged 3-24 years using the Rochester Health Status Survey IV (RHSS-IV) by conducting a structured individual interview to provide a comparative item for functional status and use of assistive technology in Macedonia. Results: Children with ASD have a lower functional status in performing daily activities required for eating, dressing, showering and using the toilet (p = 0.000), as well as acquiring academic knowledge and skills (p = 0.000). Children with ASD use more assistive technology (p = 0.032) as opposed to neurotypical children and the most commonly used are alternative and aumentative devices (p = 0.002). Conclusions: Most children with ASD have a lower functional status in performing the daily activities required for eating, dressing, showering and using the toilet, as well as acquiring academic knowledge and skills unlike their peers with neurotypical development. Also, children with ASD use alternative and augmentative devices, which is not the case with children in the control group. Accurate quantification is crucial for the progress and positive outcome of children with ASD. © 2021},

abstract={This virtual classroom has created a lot of challenges for students with limited access to the technology (computer or smartphone) or the Internet and especially for the parents of children with developmental disabilities, including children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD is a lifelong disorder and characterized by difficulties in social communication skills and may exhibit a restricted or repetitive set of behaviors. The number of children with ASD is soaring worldwide. There are no platforms that facilitate remote and interactive learning for children with ASD. In this paper, we describe the process of ideation, and design of an interactive educational platform that utilizes the role of mixedreality (real-time teaching and virtual teaching) to enable remote learning for children with ASD. This work is a product of our continuous collaboration with special education and assistive technology centers based in Qatar in which we have developed an augmented reality (AR) vocabulary learning application for children with ASD in English and Arabic. The application provides the learning of letters and words in an interactive environment. We plan to extend this app to a fulleducational platform using mixed-reality. The ideation and design processes were conducted collaboratively with teachers and specialists. In this platform, the child will be learning in a real-time environment when a teacher, child, and parents are all online together at a given time; however, in the absence of a teacher, a robotic talkative avatar would support a child and its parents in a virtual environment. The teachers will also have the capability to communicate with the children and their parents through the platform. It will also allow teachers, specialists, and parents to monitor the child’s performance as well. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Even if the use of distance learning and E-learning has a long tradition all over the world and both have been used to keep in contact with students and to provide lessons, support and learning materials, there is an open debate on the balance between advantages and disadvantages in the use of distance learning. This debate is even more central in their use to support students with Learning Disabilities (LDs), an overarching group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect more than 5% of students. The current COVID-19 outbreak caused school closures and the massive use of E-learning all over the world and it put higher attention on the debate of the effects of E-learning. This paper aims to review papers that investigated the positive and negative effects of the use of Distance Learning and E-learning in students with LDs. We conducted a literature review on the relationship between Distance Learning, E-learning and Learning Disabilities, via Scopus, Eric and Google Scholar electronic database, according to Prisma Guidelines. The findings are summarized using a narrative, but systematic, approach. According to the data resulting from the papers, we also discuss issues to be analyzed in future research and in the use of E-learning during the current pandemic of COVID-19. © 2021 Petretto et al.},

Results reveal that although more than half of the students reported that they were likely to attend college, among their individualized education programs, only 44% listed postsecondary education as a primary transition goal, and just a third of parents reported expecting that their children would pursue a college education. Furthermore, parental expectations were predicted by cognitive ability, home language, access to the general education curriculum, psychological services, and occupational therapy, while actual enrollment patterns were predicted by a different set of variables: cognitive ability, self-care skills, household responsibilities, conversational skills, access to the general education curriculum, occupational therapy, assistive technology, parent-teacher meetings for postsecondary goal planning, and proportion of White students in school. The predictive patterns suggest practical implications for college-bound students on the spectrum. © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2021.},

abstract={Nowadays, artificial intelligence is a tool widely used in several areas such as medicine, personal assistance, regular/special education, leisure, among many others. Additive manufacturing development allows designing and making innovative low-cost robotic assistants for educational inclusion processes in developing countries. There are not enough assistive technologies for special education centers in Ecuador due to the lack of resources. For these reasons, in this paper, we describe the robot AsiRo-μ (multi-purpose robotic assistant, for its Spanish name). AsiRo-μ is based on the open-source 3D printed robot Inmmov. It implements the following functionalities: hand gestures recognition, automatic speech recognition and text to speech function through the IBM Watson Cloud services, and gesture imitation. The robot aims to conduct a dialogue with the children, motivate them to carry out the exercises/rehabilitation activities, and motivate and engage them in the therapy sessions (for children with disabilities). To determine the children’s acceptance level, we carried out a pilot experiment with two groups of children. The first group consisted of 7 children with multiple disabilities (intellectual disability, Joubert syndrome, Down Syndrome, Autism, etc.), whereas in the second participated 30 children aged between 4 and 6 years (without disabilities). Each child interacted with the robot, and a group of experts evaluated the children’s perceptions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Systematic review methodology was used to limit bias in the search of electronic databases, and relevant studies were selected, 20 of which met the inclusion criteria for the review. The findings of these studies indicate that AAC systems are able to facilitate and enhance communication skills in children with ASD.

abstract={BACKGROUND: Assistive technologies are playing a vital role in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. OBJECTIVE: The current paper presents the design and assessment of an 'all-in-one' wearable solution incorporating location monitoring, scheduling, communication, and physiological parameters monitoring functionalities for children with autism and their families/carers. METHODS: Twenty high-functioning children and twenty-five parents participated in the research. The final application was assessed over a period of two months. A highly patient-centred design was followed by a multidisciplinary team of experts (experts in the field of special education, speech therapy, psychology, and informatics) with significant experience in children with autism. The evaluation took place in a real and open environment. All participants were administered the PYTHEIA questionnaire in order to assess the various characteristics of the platform. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to examine the independence of the variables, with a statistical significance of 95%. RESULTS: The results support that the implemented features can effectively assist everyday life activities and facilitate the independent living of children with autism. The subjective evaluation of the solution revealed important considerations for further developments. Both groups of users (parents and children) were very satisfied with the implemented functionalities. The flexibility given by the PYTHEIA instrument was very important for the subjective assessment of the different functionalities of the solution. All examined axes were found excellent in terms of their adaptability in daily life activities. CONCLUSIONS: Real-world applications, able to run in an open and uncontrolled environment are critical for this population. PYTHEIA is a valuable instrument that supports the assessment of the device and application as a whole, as well as the evaluation of individual features and functions. © 2021 - IOS Press.

abstract={PURPOSE: To perform a scoping review of the evidence for therapeutic interventions to manage functional impairments associated with Rett syndrome (RTT) throughout the lifespan. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Scopus and Index to Chiropractic Literature were searched systematically up to December 2019. Two investigators independently reviewed all search results and extracted those that met the inclusion criteria. Human and animal model studies pertaining to therapies that increase functional ability or treat RTT-associated symptoms in all age groups were included. Relevant studies were grouped into intervention categories and rated using the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine Levels of Evidence. Demographics of participants, interventions, and outcomes were summarized. RESULTS: Ninety-one articles representing 88 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 80 were human clinical studies and eight were studies using animal models. Study designs were primarily case series and only six studies involved participants above the age of 40. CONCLUSION: A small number of rigorously studied rehabilitation interventions have been published. Published studies aim to address a wide variety of functional impairments. Research regarding implementation of therapies for older patients with RTT is lacking and requires further exploration. © 2021 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Nowadays, some developing countries are experiencing many problems regarding children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, including Indonesia. Autism Spectrum Disorder is a childhood-onset developmental disorder of the immature brain, which impairs social communication and social interactions in addition to persistent restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior or interests. Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder need special treatments, such as therapy by professional and certified therapists. However, there are limitations to the number of therapists and the therapists have difficulty using therapeutic tools that require extra preparation time, also there are only a few applications that help therapists to carry out the therapy for Autism Spectrum Disorder children, especially applications that are developed in Indonesian and have complete features. Therefore, in this study, we proposed Squizzy, which is an assistive technology application that specifically designed as educational software for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and developed in a tablet environment. During the development of Squizzy, we implemented Scrum methodology that will be explained in detail later. Based on the evaluation and discussion that conducted, Squizzy received many positive feedbacks from users, such as it helps therapists and parents to ease their therapy sessions by reducing the inconvenience of the therapeutic tool. Moreover, Squizzy successfully covered the cognitive part of children's therapy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this meta-analytic review, we investigated the effects of technology supports on the acquisition of shopping skills for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) between the ages of 5 and 24. Nineteen single-case experimental research studies, presented in 15 research articles, met the current study’s inclusion criteria and the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) standards. An analysis of potential moderators was conducted, and we calculated effect sizes using Tau-U to examine the impact of age, diagnosis, and type of technology on the reported outcomes for the 56 participants. The results from the included studies provide evidence that a wide range of technology interventions had a positive impact on shopping performance. These positive effects were seen for individuals across a wide range of ages and disability types, and for a wide variety of shopping skills. The strongest effect sizes were observed for technologies that provided visual supports rather than just auditory support. We provide an interpretation of the findings, implications of the results, and recommended areas for future research. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={Inclusive ‘relaxed performances’ are leisure activities where people can participate, within a theatre environment, often with the use of assistive technologies, adapted texts and scripts that support interaction and social inclusion. This paper presents a participatory collaborative research project that examines the challenges faced by people living with disability when accessing theatre performances, and how design, technology and adaptations can facilitate participation and promote empowerment. Embracing a participatory approach with attention given to persons with visual impairments, people with mobility impairments persons with language and communication limitations and those on the autism spectrum, data was collected in 4 phases, from the pre-performance to the presentation of the performance. Post-performance analysis used interpretive approaches and evaluation analysis. Results include the development of potential strategies for the inclusion of people from all perspectives in performances. These strategies include the use of audio description which provides visual information about gestures, props and the layout of the stage. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a childhood disorder which affects social and interpersonal communication. Using video game programmes might be considered as complementary assistive technology tools to teach socio-emotional skills; however, there has been limited incorporation of the view and input of key stakeholders during the design of these programmes. This study aimed to collect stakeholders’ ideas by involving 20 participants, including children and youth with high functioning ASD, and their parents, during usability testing of an interactive motion gaming programme that focuses on perspective taking. After developing the game in consultation with stakeholders, we asked participants to provide us with feedback on how to further improve it. Participants commented on three main areas that should be elevated including: (a) design– How it looks and sound, (b) maintaining engagement–How it feels, and (c) fine-tuned feedback. This helped us to incorporate the user’s ideas and enhance the user-friendliness of the system prior to launching the system. This study is one of the first projects that incorporated both children/youth with ASD and their parents’ comments during the development of a novel motion gaming programme to address perspective taking. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine educators’ and specialists’ provision of communication adjustments for students on the autism spectrum in mainstream and supported education settings. Method: Secondary analysis of data collected from educators and specialists in the Australian Autism Educational Needs Analysis was undertaken. Thematic analysis of adjustment descriptions identified 11 categories. The use of the 11 specific adjustment categories with reference to (a) participant group (educator versus specialists), and (b) setting (mainstream versus supported) were described and associations investigated using Chi-square analyses. Result: Only 32% of the 381 educators and specialists reported using adjustments. Of the adjustments reported, those categorised as “Multimodal Communication”, “Structured Teaching”, and “Assistive Technology” were frequently included by both groups. Significant associations were apparent between groups and the use of specific adjustments including naturalistic communication strategies. Significant differences were evident in the proportion of specific adjustments used by participants in supported as opposed to mainstream settings. Conclusion: Possible reasons for the differences in the adjustments reported by educators and specialists and the role that setting may play in these are discussed. These include resourcing, the choice of adjustment being driven by school setting rather than student need, and possible differences between professionals in describing the adjustments made. © 2020 The Speech Pathology Association of Australia Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: In recent years more and more students with disabilities are included in general education settings; there is an increased demand for assistive technology application to accommodate their special needs in inclusive settings. This creates an atmosphere for studies on assistive technology applications in K-12 settings. Method: This synthesis study reviewed research articles related to this topic in the past decade. Ten key words were used and relevant databases were searched. Results: Thirty articles were found. After sorting, reviewing and analyzing; the two authors used seven research articles for the study on assistive technology applications in contemporary k-12 schools. Conclusion: The researchers that examined school aged children, all agreed that children with disabilities would benefit from the use of assistive technology. However, they also agree that teachers are not prepared to incorporate advanced technology in the classroom. The results also show that children with physical disabilities in preschool may be too young to independently use advanced technology. Implications for Rehabilitation Students with severe disabilities often have limited interactions with same age peers. Technology can provide a means to increase the quality and quantity of time interacting with young student's peers. Robotic technology has been proven to greatly assist with these interactions. In order for a student to maintain a rehabilitation program, they need to be engaged. Current technology promotes building recreational skills that lead to classroom skills, within entertaining and engaging activities. Daily life skills can be impacted by severe disabilities. Assistive technology has been proven to assist with these issues. Caregivers for children with autism reported improvement for life skills activities using both low- and high-tech methods. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Objectives: Atypical executive functions (EF) have long been observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) of any age. To compensate for EF-related difficulties and to cope with the demands of daily life, assistive technology for cognition may represent a valid solution, but at present, no information is available on the range of accessible solutions nor on their effectiveness in ASD. This paper reports on a review conducted to identify assistive technologies that may compensate for EF-related difficulties in ASD. Methods: A systematic search was conducted following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) reporting guideline recommendations. Results: Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria, with most studies following a single-subject research design (n = 11). The assistive technologies identified were grouped into two categories (context-aware, mobile) addressing four EF-related cognitive processes classified according to the taxonomy proposed by the International Classification of Functioning (i.e., organization and planning, time management, cognitive flexibility, and insight). Insight (e.g., self-monitoring) resulted as the only intervention that may be considered evidence-based. Conclusions: This review highlights that assistive technology may be effective in compensating for specific EF-related difficulties in ASD, but more rigorous research involving (a) a wider range of EF-related skills, (b) older participants, and (c) diverse settings (e.g., workplaces) is necessary. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The current state of computer vision methods applied to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research has not been well established. Increasing evidence suggests that computer vision techniques have a strong impact on autism research. The primary objective of this systematic review is to examine how computer vision analysis has been useful in ASD diagnosis, therapy and autism research in general. A systematic review of publications indexed on PubMed, IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital Library was conducted from 2009 to 2019. Search terms included [‘autis*’ AND (‘computer vision’ OR ‘behavio* imaging’ OR ‘behavio* analysis’ OR ‘affective computing’)]. Results are reported according to PRISMA statement. A total of 94 studies are included in the analysis. Eligible papers are categorised based on the potential biological/behavioural markers quantified in each study. Then, different computer vision approaches that were employed in the included papers are described. Different publicly available datasets are also reviewed in order to rapidly familiarise researchers with datasets applicable to their field and to accelerate both new behavioural and technological work on autism research. Finally, future research directions are outlined. The findings in this review suggest that computer vision analysis is useful for the quantification of behavioural/biological markers which can further lead to a more objective analysis in autism research. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={This paper aims to explore the role assistive technologies (ATs) might play in helping people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and a concomitant responsibility deficit become more morally responsible. Toward this goal, the authors discuss the philosophical concept of responsibility, with a reliance on Nicole Vincent's taxonomy of responsibility concepts. They then outline the ways in which ASD complicates ascriptions of responsibility, particularly responsibility understood as a capacity. Further, they explore the ways in which ATs might improve a person's capacity so that responsibility can be properly ascribed to them. After demonstrating that although assistive technologies are likely to be able to enhance a person's capacity in such a way so that responsibility can be ascribed to them, the authors assert that these technologies will have a number of additional effects on the other aspects of the concept of responsibility. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

abstract={Recent studies show that children affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are more exposed to pathologies related to obesity and lack of movement. Moreover, they are approximately twice as likely to die from drowning than neurotypical ones. Therefore, acquiring good water safety skills is of extreme importance and, at the same time, aquatic activities are a valid opportunity to do some physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviors. "iBall to Swim is a serious game, based on IoT, that through a playful approach allows children with ASD to do activities in an aquatic environment, developing and improving motor skills. The system is made of a swimming ball augmented with lighting, a wetsuit with a heartbeat monitor and wireless bone conduction headphones. A mobile application is used to integrate these components and to measure and monitor the child's performance. To test whether the technology contributed to improve children's motor skills, we performed a test with eleven children with ASD. Their improvement in motor skills has been studied during a water training phase both with the help of the serious game and without. Results show that there was a general improvement in their performance and children were keeping swimming autonomously and for a longer distance when they were stimulated by the game. Furthermore, the children reported enjoyment and the parents asked whether the game could be used routinely with their children. These encouraging findings suggest that "iBall to Swim is a promising way to enhance the learning of the basic notions of swimming and it can be considered a valid tool to help to improve ASD children's health and wellbeing. © 2020 ACM.},

As an instantiation of this idea we tackle a problem that affects and hurts millions worldwide: photosensitivity. Any time an affected person opens a website, video, or some other medium that contains an adverse visual stimulus, either intended or unintended, they might experience a seizure with potentially significant consequences. We show how a deep network can learn a video-to-video transformation rendering such stimuli harmless while otherwise preserving the video. This approach uses a specification of the adverse phenomena, the forward transformation, to learn the inverse transformation. We show how such a network generalizes to real-world videos that have triggered numerous seizures, both by mistake and in politically-motivated attacks. A number of complimentary approaches are demonstrated including using a hand-crafted generator and a GAN using a differentiable perceptual metric. Such technology can be deployed offline to protect videos before they are shown or online with assistive glasses or real-time post processing. Other applications of this general technique include helping those with limited vision, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism. © 2019},

The platform supports four main axes: location monitoring, communication, scheduling, physiological parameters monitoring. The application runs on Android Smartphones and Smartwatches with Wear OS. The research supports that an appropriate combination of the above features can effectively assist everyday life activities and facilitate the independent living of the targeted population. Forty-five subjects (twenty high-functioning children with autism and twenty-five parents/carers) participated in the study. The subjective evaluation of the solution revealed important considerations for further developments. Real-world applications, able to run in an open and uncontrolled environment are critical for this population. Based on the findings, it appears that the proposed solution can be proved valuable to children with ASD, making their lives and their carers' and parents' lives easier. © 2020 ACM.},

Results showed minimally verbal autistic children could use the tablet interface to control or respond to a humanoid robot and could understand the face learning activities. We found that a flexible and powerful wizard-of-oz tablet interface respected the needs of the children and their teachers.

Based on qualitative expert interviews at the European level, the role and scope of ATs in these fields are described for three types of disabilities: visual impairment, hearing impairment, and autism spectrum disorder. The findings show that digitalization processes entail major opportunities and challenges for ATs in all three fields and that further measures are needed to bring technical opportunities to their full potential in adverse social contexts. Regarding future technology development, the authors propose a development strategy focusing strongly on the social context of the devices.

abstract={Background Individual Education Program (IEP) is a basic educational curriculum designed specifically for the disabled, which parallels the normal curriculum in an ordinary education system. If disabled or ordinary students succeed in the curriculum, it allows them to proceed from one grade to another and from one stage to another. Purpose The study aimed to determine the role of assistive technology in the success of the Individual Education Program for disabled students in Jordan. Methodology The data was collected from a purposive sample which consists of 129 teachers teaching students from different categories of disability, such as; mental, motor, auditory, visual, and autism disorder. Data was collected from centers and institutions of special education in the governorates of Mafraq and Irbid located in Jordan. A set of questionnaire consisting 45 items focusing on nine specific areas; communication, academic, sensory, kinetic, social, self-care, daily life, organization, and computer use, was distributed. Data was analysed using the descriptive approach consisting of a multi-variance analysis, mean values and the standard deviations. Findings The role of assistive technology in the success of IEP curriculum for student with disabilities was high for all the nine areas of the questionnaire. Most importantly, it was found that there are no statistically significant differences (a = 0.05) attributed to the variables including the type of disability and the sex of the teacher. Significance The findings suggest that the governorates of Mafraq and Irbid, specifically, and the governorates of other states in Jordan, generally, should conduct courses for teachers who are teaching the disabled students, on the types of assistive technology that can be used in all areas of the IEP and on how to use and sustain it. © 2020 SERSC.},

Professional development for educators is challenging in rural areas due to the lack of opportunities and travel requirements. Project ECHO™ was originally developed to overcome similar challenges facing physicians. The ECHO Model overcomes these challenges by creating a hub and spoke network that connects local providers with experts. These networks meet regularly over teleconferencing technology to conduct a short professional development workshop, followed by a case-study from one of the local sites. We adapted the ECHO Model for use in education and since 2014 implemented four networks: autism, assistive technology, secondary transitions, and behavioral supports. Educators found ECHO highly acceptable and reported improved skills and knowledge. ECHO for Education is effective and has the potential to improve capacity of education systems in rural settings. © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2020.},

Our main focus in this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a robot-enhanced intervention on turn-taking abilities. We aim to identify to what degree social robots can improve turn-taking skills and whether this type of intervention provides similar or better gains than standard intervention. This study presents a series of 5 single-subject experiments with children with autism spectrum disorder aged between 3 and 5 years. Each child receives 20 intervention sessions (8 robot-enhanced sessions—robot-enhanced treatment (RET), 8 standard human sessions—standard human treatment, and 4 sessions with the intervention that was more efficient). Our findings show that most children reach similar levels of performance on turn-taking skills across standard human treatment and RET, meaning that children benefit to a similar extent from both interventions. However, in the RET condition, children seemed to see their robotic partner as being more interesting than their human partner, due to the fact that they looked more at the robotic partner compared with the human partner. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Volunteer activities can provide opportunities to learn new skills, build social networks, and contribute to enhanced self-esteem. Volunteering also provides a positive contribution to society, and an opportunity to participate in activities that may differ from those in paid employment. People with severe disabilities and complex communication needs, however, may face significant barriers in participating and communicating in volunteer activities. A multiple-probe-across-participants, single-case experimental design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of videos with integrated visual scene displays (video VSDs). The video VSDs were presented using a tablet-based augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) app, as an intervention to increase the percent of steps completed independently within a volunteer activity. Participants were four adolescents with autism spectrum disorder or Down syndrome, all of whom had complex communication needs. Each participant met the mastery criterion for the activity–completion of the volunteer work activities and communication exchanges with co-volunteers–with the use of the video VSDs. The results provide preliminary evidence that video VSDs may be an effective assistive technology for individuals with severe disabilities and complex communication needs to increase participation in volunteer activities, both as an instructional support in learning new skills, and as an AAC technique to support interaction with others. © 2020, © 2020 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.},

Virtual reality (VR) techniques have been tried in several studies to improve the shopping skills of people with ASD. However, in these VR applications, the effectiveness in training people with ASD in shopping has never been tested in the real-world environments. Our studies show that individuals with ASD become anxious when exposed to a new environment such as a supermarket, without knowing what to do next. Also, VR applications are less accessible, portable, or affordable compared to the emerging mobile augmented reality (AR) applications. Therefore, we have created a mobile AR application that augments real shopping scenes with visual-audio annotations via object recognition, barcode reading, and automatic categorization. Through a user-friendly visual interface, the app can help people with ASD learn shopping skills effectively, by guiding them through the shopping process step by step in a real environment with AR.

abstract={Purpose: Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems are very often abandoned by the users and caregivers due to potential challenges in implementation. This study aimed at exploring the use of Communication Supports Inventory-Children and Youth (CSI-CY), based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health-Children and Youth (ICF-CY), as a potential tool for identifying barriers and facilitators in AAC implementation in the southern part of India. Method: The CSI-CY was administered to the parents of a child with cerebral palsy and a child with autism spectrum disorder, respectively. Environmental facilitators and barriers that affect communication were rated. A semi-structured interview was also conducted to identify additional barriers and facilitators as identified by parents. Results: Barriers related to services and policies, people and assistive technology, were identified for both cases. Additionally, the semi-structured interview identified barriers related to myths, clinicians, child, AAC use, economy and society. Conclusion: CSI-CY is a potential tool for clinicians to systematically identify and document barriers and facilitators to implement AAC. It can further assist them in setting goals and defining the necessary intervention for each child with disability. Early use of AAC contributes to better therapeutic outcomes. Training should be given to professionals, special need educators and school teachers about different AACs and the appropriate techniques to be used. Counselling and evidence from earlier successful AAC interventions can dispel existing myths. Awareness programmes, group discussions and training on AAC can be done to eliminate barriers that may exist among rehabilitation professionals in India. © 2020, Action for Disability Regional Rehabilitation Centre.

abstract={In this article, a stress monitoring system tailored for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and developed for the educational institution is presented. People with ASD face problems with effective stress management due to their high self-perceived levels of stress, poor ability to cope with it, and difficulties with the accurate detection of the source of stress. Consistently, being able to measure stress appears to be highly vital for this specific group. The design and construction of the measuring system are introduced. The stress monitoring system including autonomic wearable device (wristband), both the electronics and mechanical part, as well as the software application for data analysis are shown. The wearable device includes sensors for measuring heart rate, skin resistance, temperature and movement. A dedicated software application allows for generating reports to evaluate therapeutic effects. The complex stress monitoring system has been tested in an educational institution. It can provide significant support in the stress management of people with ASD and become a meaningful assistance in the therapy of neurodiverse individuals. CCBY},

abstract={Purpose: It is important to promote assistive technologies to improve quality of life. The proposed SmartAbility Android Application recommends assistive technologies for people with reduced physical abilities, by focussing on actions that can be performed independently. Materials and methods: The SmartAbility Application uses Android built-in sensors, e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope and application programming interfaces (APIs) to detect physical abilities, e.g., head movements and blowing and recommend suitable assistive technologies. This is supported by a MySQL database that stores assistive technologies and mappings between abilities. The underpinning research is the SmartAbility Framework that culminates the knowledge obtained during previously feasibility trials and usability evaluations. Results: The Application was evaluated by pupils (n=18) at special educational needs schools with physical conditions, including cerebral palsy, autism and Noonan syndrome, and assessed through the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) and System Usability Scale (SUS). Analysis using the Adjective Rating Scale highlighted that the Application achieves “Good Usability”. Conclusion: The SmartAbility Application demonstrates that built-in sensors of Android devices and their APIs, can detect actions that users perform, e.g., head movements and speaking. The Application contains a database where assistive technologies are mapped to physical abilities, in order to provide suitable recommendations. It will be disseminated to assistive technology charities and manufacturers and be used by healthcare professionals as part of the rehabilitation process. Future developments of SmartAbility include the creation of a second Application designed specifically to recommend assistive technologies for the education sector, based on users’ physical and cognitive abilities.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Assistive technology is any item, equipment or piece of software designed to increase, maintain or improve the functional capabilities of people with disabilities. SmartAbility should be introduced into rehabilitation to promote awareness of assistive technologies that are suitable for the physical abilities of the user. Our research highlighted that physical abilities can be detected using built-in sensors of Android devices, e.g. accelerometer and gyroscope. Involvement of the intended user community during evaluations is essential to ensure that a smartphone application is suitable for people with reduced physical abilities. Assistive technologies can support the rehabilitation of people with reduced physical abilities by providing increased independence and improved quality of life. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: The use of assistive technology in mental health has gained an increased interest over the last decades. A growing number of studies have investigated diverse applications of technological interventions for rehabilitation of children with neurodevelopmental disorders. This article presents a map of the technological devises applied as therapeutic instruments. Methods: The research question of this review was which technological applications could be referred as an educational instrument for the management of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), intellectual disability and attention deficit disorder. The articles included in this review were collected after a structured literature search in electronic databases using keywords such as “Assistive Technology”, “technology devices”, “robots”, “Autism Disorder”, “Intellectual Disabilities” and “Mental Retardation”. Results: Assistive technology with the most up-to-date devices and applications helps children with intellectual disability and ASDs enhance cognitive skills and improve challenging behaviour, social communication and academic performance. Different technological tools are used to foster attention span and improve time management skills in children with attention deficit syndrome. Conclusion: It is important that therapists choose the instrument that will offer the best approach towards the goal that is set. Future research could provide evidence based data, evaluating each specific methodology and tailoring each therapeutic approach specifically to a case.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Technology creates environments in which children could practice and learn in a safer, more predictable and pleasant manner. Assistive Technologies provide the opportunity for better acquisition of selfhelp skills and the power of social interaction for individuals with disabilities. By mapping out the wide array of Assistive Technology that is available today, future applications for rehabilitation of children with neurodevelopmental disorders could help extend therapeutic strategies out of the clinical and school settings and into the home, thereby incorporating the family and emphasizing personalization. Future studies could develop a model for the choice and use of each tool, tailoring each therapeutic approach specifically to each case. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The term Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been increasingly studied by researchers and disseminated by scientific media. People with ASD exhibit peculiar social characteristics that often interferes in their communication with other people. Therefore the need to offer new possibilities to pursue better communication for these people trough assistive technologies. The present article aims to identify what national and international scientific productions, published between 2013 and 2018 have revealed about the use of augmented reality and alternative communication of people with ASD. The results shows that assistive technology contributes to increase or expand functional abilities of people with disabilities and therefore promotes independent life and inclusion. Otherwise it is observed that unknowing the disorder and lacking specified strategy for it may cause small impact upon the learning process of ASD population. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that may lead to significant impairment in social communication, repetitive patterns of behavior, and possible fixed and restricted interests. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a well-supported and evidence-based treatment for the delays attributed to ASD. Assistive technologies, such as gamification, software apps, computer-based training (Web), and robotics; provide a standardized method of implementing ABA techniques. This review provides a synthesis of the main characteristics of these technologies. The assessed proposals focused on technologies such as Distributed Systems, Image Processing, Gamification, and Robotics. The primary objectives of these tools sought to improve social behavior, attention, communication, and reading skills. Some common limitations found in the literature was a failure to accurately define their target audience, and a failure to comply with the dimensions of ABA as defined by Baer, Wolf, and Risley in 1968. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This study examines the efficacy of robots as assistive technology (AT) learning tools for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study attempts to find answers to whether robots as assistive tools can (i) profoundly improve achievement in learning and (ii) provide valuable learning experiences among this group of children. Using LEGO Mindstorms EV3, a robot was built and programmed to teach the basic concept of place value in mathematics. Eight children with ASD, specifically, four females and four males, participated in the single case study, and six special education teachers took part in the interviews. The children participated in both traditional and robotic intervention lessons and were assessed at the end of each session. The results indicate a positive increase in content knowledge and an improved disposition toward learning, thus demonstrating the potential utilization of robots as AT tools for harnessing classroom learning. Data from the interviews with teachers highlighted four valuable learning experiences that occurred in the classrooms as a result of the robotic interventions; namely, with respect to young children with ASD, the AT (1) promoted interest and engagement, (2) increased attention and focus, (3) triggered interactions and communication, and (4) created a happy and fun learning environment. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Teaching exceptional students through assistive technology is very important for the cognitive city. Due to the gradual progress of medical treatment and the educational diagnosis, the number of confirmed cases of students with Autism is rising in Taiwan. These students not only demonstrated serious deficits in social skills but also a tremendous lack of understanding of abstract and cognitive concepts. Based on the viewpoints above, the main topic of this research is using “Art Tour with Classmates” as the topic of a story to pair with the main ideas of teaching in Social Skills Curriculum Outline for Disabilities-Related Special Needs Areas in 12-year National Educational Curriculum to develop four virtual reality teaching systems. This study was conducted upon a group of ten autistic students from primary and middle school. This study aims to understand the effectiveness of virtual reality teaching methods for students’ social skills. After eight weeks of teaching, we used One-way ANOVA to analyze and explain the results of the overall teaching data. It was found that the students’ performance in overall social skills has significantly improved and they made the most progress in “The completeness of sentence-structure”. Thus we effectively improved the integrity of students’ content after the experimental teaching of virtual reality social skills. Finally, through the experimental teaching of virtual reality social skills, students will soon accommodate themselves to the new surroundings and be willing to try their activities. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.},

abstract={A large number of people in China have been affected by Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). However, different factors associated with current barriers to accessing external support by ASD individuals in China have been identified. Assistive technologies are believed to help address the barriers. To obtain an in-depth understanding of the need and barriers of Chinese individuals with ASD in using assistive technologies, this study surveyed parents of ASD children, ASD professionals, as well as technology developers in the field. This study found that people in China have lower awareness and utilization of assistive technologies but similar demands for technologies when compared to those in the United Kingdom. Monitoring and informing systems, therapeutic recommendation systems and social skill training applications are major forms of assistive technologies desired by the participants in the interviews. Concerns about affordability, public exposure, confidentiality breaches and possible side-effects are considered as barriers that may prevent ASD individuals in China from using assistive technologies. The paper further discussed potential orientations of assistive technology development in China. Considering Chinese individuals may suffer intense stigma and heavy financial burden on mental disabilities, affordable mobile applications that help reduce the stigma would be more acceptable by Chinese ASD individuals. © 2020, © 2020 RESNA.},

Studies conducted in this field in recent years show that the use of robots as collaborators may have positive effects on the development of social skills in children with ASD, especially in those areas where they reveal great deficits. In this literature review, we present, organize and evaluate the most important features and results of 13 relevant scientific articles. In analysis of the research findings we explored the documented effectiveness of robotics in enhancing the social skills of children with ASD in the areas of mutual attention, verbal communication and imitation skills, and also in the reduction of stereotypical behavior.

abstract={Background: Technology and social media offer individuals with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (I/DD) unique and innovative ways to facilitate active participation in their own healthcare process. What remains unclear is the extent to which devices are currently used by this growing patient population. Objective: To explore the prevalence of technology and social media use, as well as the possible barriers, among adult patients with I/DD. Methods: A cross-sectional study utilizing an anonymous, accessible survey was used to obtain data from all adult patients (18 + years of age) with I/DD presenting for primary care services at a healthcare facility in New York between September and December of 2016. Results: A total of 370 individuals completed the survey (529 approached, 69.9% response rate). Less than half (44.6%) of respondents used devices such as a tablet, smartphone or desktop; most (86.8%) did not use social media. Only 21.6% of respondents indicated that they use some type of assistive technology. While some respondents (46.0%) were identified by their caregivers as having a disability that would prevent them from learning/using technology, other respondents reported having no challenges (18.0%), needing training and/or ongoing support (7.4%), or being uncertain as to whether they would experience any challenges (15.5%). Conclusions: Many adult patients with I/DD do not use technology and social media that could promote self-determination and participation in their healthcare. Continued efforts must be made to promote technology use among adults with I/DD and to ensure that appropriate training is available for both the individual and his/her caregivers to achieve adoption and utilization. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Symbols in general can be read, regardless of the person's language or literacy skills. Therefore, people with communication difficulties may benefit from using symbols to communicate, express their needs and to access education. Various types of AAC system can aid and assist people with disability who particularly have speech and language impairments by providing alternative means of communication using symbols. This will contribute to improving their quality of life. Nevertheless, there are ongoing obstacles facing the Arab region as the result of minimal numbers of Arabic symbols available and the dependency on already developed symbols from the other regions, particularly Europe and America. Therefore, endorsement and the positive effect of using AAC have been inadequate in the practice. The project Tawasol Symbols aimed at this challenge with a free selection of symbols that is culturally, socially, religiously and linguistically acceptable. Mada made available free of charge bilingual Arabic/English symbol dictionary of commonly used words in spoken and written communication embodied by pictures and pictograms. Tawasol was based on the Arasaac Symbols Collection. Symbols can be modified to meet the needs of other language, communities and needs. Tawasol symbols and later devolved Tawasol App cater to people who are non-verbal or minimally verbal, particularly children with autism who require an alternative communication solution. Through natural speech and capacity to build sentences in Arabic using a large set of symbols, Tawasol AAC App provides an excellent assistive technology solution for people with disability in Qatar and Arab region. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Objective: Today, most of the individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have atypical sensory behaviors. The main aim of this study is to propose an assistive intervention for supporting the overloaded sensory responses in hypersensitive individuals with ASD. Methods: The vision, auditory, smell, and physical balance related multi-sensors based hardware prototype, namely Assistive Companion for Hypersensitive Individuals (ACHI) has been designed for individuals with ASD. The proposed ACHI prototype is an assistive-technology based companion for hypersensitive individuals with ASD which is able to ‘fetch/detect the sensory information using electronic sensors’, ‘making the decision using fuzzy logic on the basis of fetched sensory information’ and then, ‘transmit the generated information over the internet through the Internet of Things (IoT)’, and also able for ‘generating alerts to caregivers’. The proposed design is also capable of providing audio & video feedback to calm down individuals with ASD. Results: After testing, it is observed that 93% percent of the caregivers rated the proposed ACHI intervention on the scale of above average. The remarkable reduction in hyperactive states related triggering incidents in ASD has been found with the use of ACHI. Conclusion: The present work and the proposed prototype can identify and control the sensory overload triggers in ASD and it can guide the caregiver or clinicians to optimize the responsible surrounding causes of explosive behavior in ASD and would help the individuals with ASD to become calm. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The computational analysis of facial expressions is an emerging research topic that could overcome the limitations of human perception and get quick and objective outcomes in the assessment of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., Autism Spectrum Disorders, ASD). Unfortunately, there have been only a few attempts to quantify facial expression production and most of the scientific literature aims at the easier task of recognizing if either a facial expression is present or not. Some attempts to face this challenging task exist but they do not provide a comprehensive study based on the comparison between human and automatic outcomes in quantifying children's ability to produce basic emotions. Furthermore, these works do not exploit the latest solutions in computer vision and machine learning. Finally, they generally focus only on a homogeneous (in terms of cognitive capabilities) group of individuals. To fill this gap, in this paper some advanced computer vision and machine learning strategies are integrated into a framework aimed to computationally analyze how both ASD and typically developing children produce facial expressions. The framework locates and tracks a number of landmarks (virtual electromyography sensors) with the aim of monitoring facial muscle movements involved in facial expression production. The output of these virtual sensors is then fused to model the individual ability to produce facial expressions. Gathered computational outcomes have been correlated with the evaluation provided by psychologists and evidence has been given that shows how the proposed framework could be effectively exploited to deeply analyze the emotional competence of ASD children to produce facial expressions. © 2019 by the authors.},

In designing games for three neurodiverse children, we explore how designing for sensory diversity can be understood through a formal game design framework. Our process reveals that by using sensory processing needs as requirements we can make sensory and social accessible play spaces. We contribute empirical findings for accommodating sensory differences for neurodiverse children in a way that supports inclusive play. Specifically, we detail the sensory driven design choices that not only support the enjoyability of the leisure activities, but that also support the social inclusion of sensory-diverse participants. The participants displayed behaviors in the multi-user version consistent with their behaviors in the single user version with the addition of social behavior. We tie these techniques to game design mechanics to iterate on our efforts to support inclusive game development. Preliminary results are discussed. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Autistic children are increasingly a focus of technology research within the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community. We provide a critical review of the purposes of these technologies and how they discursively conceptualise the agency of autistic children. Through our analysis, we establish six categories of these purposes: Behaviour analysis, assistive technologies, education, social skills, therapy and well-being. Further, our discussion of these purposes shows how the technologies embody normative expectations of a neurotypical society, which predominantly views autism as a medical deficit in need of 'correction'. Autistic children-purportedly the beneficiaries of these technologies-thus become a secondary audience to the largely externally defined purposes.We identify a lack of design for technologies that are geared towards the interests, needs and desires of autistic children. To move HCI's research into autism beyond this, we provide guidance on how to consider agency in use and explicitly allow for appropriation beyond externally driven goals. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Background: Nowadays, in the Internet of Things era, wearables, mobile technologies and enhanced communication and computing capabilities has led to the upsurge of innovative mobile health solutions. Many research efforts have taken place recently in the domain of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Method: The current paper presents a thorough review of the literature on the use of wearables and mobile technologies for ASD-related interventions. It intends to give insights and guidelines to researchers in order to develop more useful and closer to market products. Results: We searched seven databases for research articles published after 2000. Of 4,722 articles initially retrieved, only 83 papers met the inclusion criteria. Several challenges still exist in the research efforts towards the development of applications exploiting the latest wearables and mobile technologies for ASD interventions: small number of participants in the studies, non-generalizable results, technology considerations, privacy, legal and ethical issues, etc. Subjective assessment is also another significant barrier for further adoption of the developed solutions. Conclusions: The findings support the notion that this is a very promising sector which is expected to undergo an important increase in the coming years. There is a great need for highly customizable solutions. In parallel, researchers should focus on the importance of developing applications for the real world and not only for controlled environments. Further studies employing artificial intelligence and affective computing are needed to support both diagnosis and therapeutic interventions as well. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Gifted children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often referred to as twice-exceptional, the term that highlights the co-occurrence of exceptional challenges and exceptional giftedness. This study performed secondary data analysis on samples of twice-exceptional children from the Pre-Elementary Education Longitudinal Study and the Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study datasets. The results provide a descriptive profile of twice-exceptional (e.g. demographics, average academic performance, and services utilized), trajectory plots that indicate how academic performance changes over time, and multilevel analyses that model growth in academic outcomes using demographics, school services, and giftedness as predictors. Some of the key findings are that twice-exceptional students show not only higher initial levels of academic performance, but they improve over time relative to the non-gifted ASD counterparts and—with the exception of Letter Word Matching—even relative to the general population. Moreover, they benefit from mental health services disproportionately. Together, the results offer a deeper understanding of the twice-exceptional autistic population, their academic performance over time, and the services that they utilize. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Visual attention is guided by the integration of two streams: the global, that rapidly processes the scene, and the local, that processes details. For people with autism, the integration of these two streams can be disrupted by the tendency to privilege details (local processing) instead of seeing the big picture (global processing). Consequently, people with autism struggle with typical visual attention, evidenced by their verbal description of local features when asked to describe overall scenes, disrupting their social understanding. This work aims to explore an augmentation for global processing by digitally filtering visual stimuli. This work contributes initial prototypes to improve global processing and leverages an eye tracking dataset to compare results as a validation technique. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

The involvement of this target population during development and design is key to ensuring that the technology is beneficial and has the potential to be adopted. This article reports on a participatory design process used for the development of an affective technology intended for users on the autism spectrum. We first briefly recapitulate concepts and theories about emotions to illuminate emotion-specific challenges faced in the design process. We then introduce biomusic, an affective technology that communicates emotional states by translating physiological signals into auditory output. The necessity of stakeholder involvement during the development of biomusic is discussed, with a focus specifically on including individuals with autism spectrum condition (ASC). Finally, we present a concrete example of a participatory sound design workshop focusing on the development of biomusic's auditory display in collaboration with adolescents with ASC. From this experience, challenges of using participatory design for the development of affective technologies with people with ASC are presented and discussed. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Acquiring daily living skills can be difficult for children and adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Increasing evidences indicate that classic occupational interventions approaches such as Discrete Trial Teaching(DTT) results to be boring and frustrating to individuals with ASD. As consequence, they spend most of the time off task and face difficulties to sustaining their selective attention. Moreover, in-person interventions are both costly and difficult to access. Evidence-based research shows that the use of augmented reality(AR) strengthens and attracts the attention of individuals with ASD, enhancing their engagement and user's task performance. However, despite of the benefits, the use of AR as an assistive technology by this segment of population, still presents low rates of adaption. Platforms such as smartphone and tablet, used to run AR technologies provokes an head-down posture that decrease the user's awareness to the physical environment putting themselves in risk of injury. Moreover, they are forced to have their hands occupied and most of the existent applications are lacks to be personalized to different user's needs. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for developing real-time personalized assistive AR-based smartglasses system. The solution aims to solve the issues related to in-person occupational interventions i.e constant need for professional supervision during intervention as well as limited intervention duration and frequency. In addition, we also target issues related to classic AR-based platforms i.e head-down postures and task-specific design. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: Over the past ten years, the authors have been designing, developing, and testing pervasive technology to support children with autism (ASD). Methods: In the present study, an integrated system based on multimedia and augmented interaction technologies have been tested on young subjects with ASD and dyspraxia in the age range of 6-10 years, in charge for rehabilitation treatments; a team of clinical psychologists has analyzed the results of the experimentation. The ten children involved in the project underwent an initial assessment of praxis skills and motor coordination. Subsequently, the subjects were subdivided into two subgroups: five children participated in the experimentation and five were evaluated as the control group (treatment as usual). Results: The evaluation showed an increased score in the several aspects considered, and particularly those related to motor coordination. An improvement in balancing tests and in hands-movement testing was found. Conclusion: The children involved in the sessions showed greater ability to self-control the movement as well as to select specific motor areas. The methods used seem to be promising to improve emotional and social skills too in a motivating and enjoyable climate. A high level of acceptance by professionals was observed and parents' feedback was also positive. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Virtual Reality (VR) has been an active area of research in the development of interactive interventions for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) for over two decades. These immersive environments create a safe platform in which therapy can address the core symptoms associated with this condition. Recent advancements in spatial audio rendering techniques for VR now allow for the creation of realistic audio environments that accurately match their visual counterparts. However, reported auditory processing impairments associated with autism may affect how an individual interacts with their virtual therapy application. This study aims to investigate if these difficulties in processing audio information would directly impact how individuals with autism interact with a presented virtual spatial audio environment. Two experiments were conducted with participants diagnosed with ASD (n = 29) that compared: (1) behavioral reaction between spatialized and non-spatialized audio; and (2) the effect of background noise on participant interaction. Participants listening to binaural-based spatial audio showed higher spatial attention towards target auditory events. In addition, the amount of competing background audio was reported to influence spatial attention and interaction. These findings suggest that despite associated sensory processing difficulties, those with ASD can correctly decode the auditory cues simulated in current spatial audio rendering techniques. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Background: The prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) appears to be increasing globally due to the complex interaction of multiple biopsychosocial and environmental factors. Mobile phones, tablets, and other electronic gadgets have transformed our means of communication, and have also changed both healthcare and how we learn. These technological enhancements may have a positive impact on the lives of children, but there is currently a global scarcity of information on how information technology influences the education of children with ASD. Objective: This study was conducted in Rwandan schools and communities, and aimed to understand the perceptions of students with ASD, their parents, and their teachers, on the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the education of those with ASD. Methods: This qualitative descriptive study was conducted from December 2017 to July 2018. Researchers conducted four focus group discussions (FGDs) with 54 participants from different backgrounds: teachers, parents, and students with ASD. Each of the FGDs took approximately two and a half hours. A predefined set of open-ended questions were selected to discover people's perceptions regarding assistive technologies used in ASD, their effectiveness, the scope of using them in their context, and upcoming challenges during implementation. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. Results: The findings of the study revealed seven key themes: (1) the use of ICT for the education of children with ASD; (2) existing augmentative facilities for learning; (3) current patterns of use of ICT in education; (4) preferred areas of learning for ASD students; (5) integration of ICT into educational programs; (6) areas of interest outside the classroom; and (7) future opportunities and challenges in Rwanda. We found most of the study participants assumed that appropriate technology and related innovations might solve the challenges faced by learners with ASD in classrooms. Moreover, they thought that children with ASD more so enjoyed watching television, playing digital games, and drawing objects using gadgets than interacting with people or playing with other children. Conclusions: The use of various low-cost technical devices can aid with teaching and the education of children with autism in Rwanda. However, this area requires further research to discover the impact ICT can have on the education of children with ASD, so this study may become a starting point for further research in the area. © 2019 JMIR Publications.

abstract={As many as half of school children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), resulting in marked negative academic, social, and behavioral outcomes. The focus of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on real-world data from novel digital sources, and the emergence of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to reimburse for digital monitoring and neurobehavioral testing suggest an increasing acceptance of the role of technology in augmenting clinical care and research. Empowered Brain is an augmented reality and artificial intelligence-based social-emotional communication aid for students with ASD. In this study, student performance on Empowered Brain is correlated to validated clinical measures of ADHD. Seven high school students with a diagnosis of ASD were recruited from a public high school. All students were assessed for severity of ADHD-related symptoms via three clinical gold-standard assessments, namely the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale 2 (SRS-2), and Teacher Report Form (TRF). Students used Empowered Brain over a one-week period. We measured the correlation of student in-game performance (as measured by point-and star-based rewards) relative to the hyperactivity subscale of the ABC (ABC-H), and the ADHD-subscale of the TRF. All seven students completed the study and managed to successfully use Empowered Brain. Students received a culminative total of 32 sessions, an average of 4.6 sessions per student (range 2–8). Student in-game performance demonstrated highly significant correlation relative to ABC-H (points: p = 0.0013; stars: p = 0.0013), and significant correlation to TRF ADHD scores (points: p = 0.012; stars: p = 0.012). No adverse effects were noted among students who used Empowered Brain. New technologies may herald novel ways of identifying and characterizing symptoms of ADHD in student populations. This study provides evidence that Empowered Brain in-game performance correlates with ADHD symptom severity in students with ASD. Larger samples are required to validate these findings, with more diverse participants that can also widen the generalizability of these findings to a broader range of brain conditions that manifest with inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Through further research, we may find that such technologies can help us to identify and longitudinally monitor such symptoms, and potentially aid in severity stratification and digital phenotyping. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Background: Early school transitions can be difficult for children, however, children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) often experience greater difficulty making the transition into school. Transition support practices, such as transition meetings, can facilitate successful school beginnings. Aims: The aim of the present study was to determine what type and amount of transition support practices early intervention (EI) service providers were implementing to support the transition to school of children with ASDs. Barriers and facilitators to transition planning were also evaluated. Methods and Procedures: Surveys were completed by program directors of 164 EI service providers across Canada. Program directors reported on transition support practices in use, as well as program level characteristics. Outcomes and Results: Overall, Canadian EI providers reported using a high frequency of high-quality, individualized transition supports for children with ASD. Major barriers included a lack of government support and elementary school engagement. Specialized transition training and offering ASD-specific services were related to an increase in transition supports. Conclusions and Implications: The present study highlights areas for improvement in transition support practice and policy. Namely, increased government support could lead to increased levels of elementary school engagement, which has important implications for children's long- and short-term educational outcomes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The inclusion of adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in mainstream environments, especially mainstream classrooms, is critically impeded by their difficulties in self-regulating their emotions. Albeit new technologies have shown tremendous emulation in the field of ASD, solutions to assist individuals with ASD in emotion regulation appear very limited. This paper addresses this critical challenge through the design and evaluation of a tablet-based application dedicated to supporting adolescents with ASD in self-regulating their emotions in mainstream inclusive classrooms. This system relies on well-proven (paper-based) emotion-regulation interventions reported by special-education teachers and families through a participatory design. The experiment included 14 adolescents with ASD (as well as 19 adolescents with Intellectual Disabilities) using the application during three months in mainstream schools. We compared these two groups with another group of 15 adolescents with ASD who were not equipped with our application. Usability performance as well as efficacy performance (emotion-regulation outcomes) have been investigated in situ. We showed that 1) our system is autonomously and successfully used in mainstream classrooms, 2) it is also an efficient support for adolescents with ASD to self-regulate their emotions. This paper demonstrates that emotion regulation of adolescents with ASD can be supported within mainstream classrooms through an assistive technology, in order to improve both behaviors and sociocognitive processes linked with core features of ASD. Moreover, it provides insights of a methodology suited to mainstream classrooms, building on previous research addressing specialized settings. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: In this case study, we discuss the application of a patient-centred clinical approach that led to the use of an assisted communication platform to combat severe communicative deficit in a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Methods: Initial assessment at four years of age revealed that the patient had rudimentary communication skills, with significant sensory integration dysfunction manifested as oral, olfactory, and tactile seeking behaviours; self-stimulatory behaviour; and complete dependence on caregiver for activities of daily living. Intensive, multi-disciplinary intervention resulted in minimal improvement in communicative skills and sensory seeking over six months. Subsequently, a tailor-made picture-assisted communication training with the mother as the communication facilitator was adopted. This approach was abandoned due to the patient’s poor response and mother’s low acceptance of picture-based interaction. A preference for printed material was observed in the patient. Accordingly, further management was focused on employing a computer-based interactive platform that the patient was taught to use over the course of a few months as a part of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) intervention program. This resulted in a remarkable improvement in the child’s skills that now allowed for a better intentional communication of his thoughts and needs. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of revisiting conventional rehabilitation strategies for communicative deficits and tailoring them according to the patient’s needs and preferences. It also emphasises that besides excellent observation skills, clinicians must be willing to consider technology based approaches in patients responding poorly to traditional approaches in order to develop effective interventional programmes.Implication for Rehabilitation The current study highlights the importance of exploring the application of technology based intervention for building communication skills in the early stages of rehabilitation for persons with communicative deficit. It also emphasises the need for excellent observation skills among clinicians so that the peculiar interests of children with ASD may be applied in designing training programmes to overcome communication barriers. Additionally, clinicians should familiarise themselves with the latest assistive technology-based rehabilitation approaches and be willing to explore newer approaches if traditional ones fail to yield satisfactory outcomes. Use of technology-based interventions to reduce dependence among persons with disability would be beneficial, both socially and economically, in developing countries with limited resources. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurological development disorder that affects communication and behavior. Most assistive technologies for children with autistic traits have been designed to support single, targeted activity function such as learning and communication. In this paper, we report the design and development of an assistive mobile application with heart rate monitoring to help children with ASD in their daily life activities. The integrated mobile application, App4Autism was developed using a holistic design approach with the aim of enhancing communication, interaction and learning skills while providing emotion regulation support through music listening and heart rate monitoring. A novel focus of App4Autism is on noise sensitivity; to play music upon automatic detection of loud excessive noise (in decibel) while at the same time, monitoring the user’s heart rate using a pulse sensor. The paper focuses on a study to better understand the potential use and incorporation of music listening and heart rate/anxiety level monitoring in the app. The paper provides results of investigation into which music genre is more suitable to keep users calm. Initial experiment involved a general population sample; with results showing that personal music preference might have calming effects on users in environments with excessive background noise. We further expand on the design guidelines for creating an integrated assistive technology. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={The use of technology-based interventions for ameliorating Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) core deficits has been growing in popularity. However, limited technologies are available that can help children with autism (aged 6 to 11) cope with changes, and these do not typically incorporate the methods used or recommended by practitioners. Our project addresses this gap through the design, development and evaluation of a prototype app to support children with ASD overcome their difficulties with changes. We report on preliminary work in developing this app, in which we decided not to involve children with ASD before getting some evidence that the app may be useful and suitable for them. Therefore, the design at this stage was informed by the research literature and design studies involving typically developing (TD) children, practitioners and researchers. The evaluation studies revealed that: 1) the app is easy to use; 2) the activities are perceived as fun and engaging; 3) the app may be suitable for children with ASD. Future work will extend the evaluation studies to include children with ASD and more practitioners. © Copyright 2019 IADIS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Autism, also known as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is an incurable brain-based disorder that refers to a wide range of complex neurodevelopment disorders characterised by marked difficulties in communication and social skills, repetitive behaviour, highly focused interests and sensory sensitivity. Autism can present challenges for affected people at the work environment and in everyday life. The barrier for individuals with ASD increases further with changing environmental situations. Individuals with ASD have limited abilities to isolate their Five senses and often experience over- or under-sensitivity to sounds, touch, tastes, smells, light, colours or temperatures. In this perspective, individuals with autism may experience extraordinary challenges during a regular day for most people, especially in non-conductive crowded environments like workplaces. This work presents a survey of the state-of-the-art implementation as well as research challenges of assisting technology for people with ASD in the workplace and in everyday life. An overview of relevant key technologies and methods is outlined by focusing both on the therapeutic perspective as well as on the technological viewpoint.

abstract={Background and objectives: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience challenges with social interactions, a core feature of the disorder. Social skills therapy has been shown to be helpful. Over the past several years, computer-assisted and robot-assisted therapies have been infiltrating the social skills teaching environment. Rapid progress in the field of technology, especially in the robotics area, offers tremendous possibilities for innovation and treatment or even education for individuals with ASD. This paper’s purpose is to drive awareness of these innovative interventions in order to support the social lives of children with ASD. The aims of the paper are identifying (1) the types of Information Technology platforms that are being evaluated in computer and robot-assisted therapies for children with ASD; (2) the various disciplines or professions studying and utilizing these computer and robot-assisted social skill therapies; (3) the outcomes being evaluated in each trial; and (4) if results demonstrate benefits to children with autism. Materials and Methods: PubMed, CINAHL, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical trials published over the past five years. Search terms incorporated the subject intersection of autism, and computer or robot-assisted therapy. Results were mined for pediatric populations only and study designs establishing controlled comparisons. Results: Eighteen unique international studies were identified that utilize robot interventions (11 studies) and serious computer game interventions (seven studies). Most demonstrated promising results in improving outcomes for children with ASD. Study implications reveal a rapidly evolving assistive technology for ASD social skills therapy. Conclusions: These interventions show considerable promise, but more effectiveness and cost effectiveness research of high quality should be carried out with larger numbers of children. Also, further studies are necessary to evaluate these technologies’ effectiveness amongst adults with ASD and within unique subsets of the higher functioning autism population. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by difficulties of socialization, disorders of verbal communication, restricted and stereotyped patterns of behaviors. Firstly, the paper reports tools of the user-centered design (UCD) used as well participants involved in the design of interactive collaborative system for children with ASD. Then, we describe the UCD deployed to design a vocal communication tool (VCT) between an adult with ASD and his family caregivers. The analyses of interviews demonstrate a strong need for a collaborative assistive technology based on voice interaction to avoid the family caregivers repeating the same sentences to the adult with ASD and, to create a friendly atmosphere at home. Observations in a real life environment demonstrate that the VCT is useful and accepted by the adult with ASD and his family. The work is not complete and issues such as designing a spoken dialogue system in the smart home need further works. The study of the type of voice synthesis (human or text-to-speech synthesis) is also an open question. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Applied Computer technologies can address the needs of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Data on the efficacy of assistive technology in ASD is limited, and its effectiveness in supporting and facilitating skill acquisition in this specific population must be still demonstrated. 63 Italian ASD subjects underwent learning activities administered by cardboards or a touch screen support. The support preference was evaluated in a choice trial, and quantitative analysis was performed on items regarding communication and challenging behaviours. Touch devices are attractive especially for males without intellectual disability and a lower communication and cooperation behaviours with the use of touch screen compared with paper support was shown depending on activities. Overall, our data do not confirm the hypothesis that touch screen presentation improves activity completion and behavioural performance for each individual with ASD. Data discourage an indiscriminate use of these devices and suggest analysing with more attention the core ingredients that should shape digital devices when used for people on ASD. © 2019 Istituto Superiore di Sanita.

abstract={Fidgeting, while primarily recognized as a distinguishing characteristic of neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism or ADHD, has also recently been recognized as a potential focus and attention aid for learning in traditional classroom environments. Everyone fidgets to greater or lesser extents, perhaps everyone can benefit from fidgeting aids to refocus attention. The recent explosion in popularity of fidgeting aids, such as fidget spinners, fidget cubes, and other toys highlights the broad appeal of these objects. Human-Computer Interaction researchers have taken an interest in the contributions of fidgeting to productivity. While these works connect the concepts of visual and motor stimulus as meaningful fidgets, little investigation has been done as to the potential contributions of haptic stimulus in digital fidgets. We designed and tested haptic mobile fidgets and compared their effects on task performance and user preference against the traditional spinner and no fidget apparatus. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.},

abstract={New technologies designed to improve the communication of autistic children can also help to promote interaction processes and cognitive and social development. The aim of this study was to analyze the instruments used to improve the communication skills of children with autism spectrum disorder. We searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases using the descriptors "autism", "Asperger", "education", "children" and "assistive technology" and selected articles that met the following inclusion criteria: (i) original research; (ii) written in English; (iii) based on participants with a primary diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder; and (iv) tested an instrument designed to promote communication in children with autism spectrum disorder. Our search retrieved 811 articles, of which 34 met the inclusion criteria. Data on 26 instruments were extracted, and the measurement properties of the instruments were combined with information about their outcomes and presentation. The most commonly used interventions were the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children program and the Picture Exchange Communication System. The Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children program was shown to produce improvements in the communication skills, socialization and self-care skills of children with autism spectrum disorder. The Picture Exchange Communication System produced inconsistent results. The results of the identified studies confirm the significant importance of these instruments in improving the communicative process of autistic children.},

First, with six children with autism, their parents and therapists we explored whether fitness bands motivate children with autism in India to increase their physical activity. Second, with five parents and specialists at the same school, we conducted interviews to understand their expectations from and current usage of technology. Previous work defines a culture-based framework for assistive technology design with three dimensions: lifestyle, socio-technical infrastructure, and monetary and informational resources. To this framework we propose a fourth dimension of socio-technical aspirations.

abstract={Background: Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) commonly demonstrate prominent social communication deficits, symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and chronic irritability. These challenges hinder academic progress and frequently persist despite educational, behavioral, and medical interventions. An assistive smartglasses technology may aid these individuals, especially if the technology is efficacious in ecologically-valid school settings. This study explored the feasibility and efficacy of Empowered Brain, a computerized smartglasses intervention designed as a socio-emotional behavioral aid for students with ASD. Methods: This two-part six-week study involved four school children with ASD from a public elementary school. The study incorporated an initial three-week feasibility stage followed by a three-week controlled longitudinal efficacy stage. Both stages involved the use of a twice-daily socio-emotional intervention with the smartglasses. Educators completed pre-intervention and post-intervention Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC) ratings at the start of the feasibility stage, and weekly during the efficacy stage. Primary outcome measures were improvements in the ABC subscales of irritability, hyperactivity, and social withdrawal. Results: Students in both feasibility and efficacy stages demonstrated improvements (decreases) in irritability, hyperactivity, and social withdrawal compared to a baseline period and control periods, respectively. Participants in the controlled efficacy stage demonstrated decreased ABC subscale scores of 90% for irritability, 41.6% for hyperactivity, and 45.6% for social withdrawal. An intervention exposure-response improvement in irritability and hyperactivity was found during the efficacy stage. Educators rated the technology as superior or vastly superior compared to other assistive technologies. Conclusion: A substantial number of school children with ASD demonstrate chronic and impairing cognitive and behavioral challenges. This study provides evidence that Empowered Brain, a smartglasses-based socio-emotional aid for autism, is both feasible and efficacious in improving symptoms of social withdrawal, irritability, and hyperactivity in students with autism. The improvement is demonstrated as part of a longitudinal school-based intervention. Further studies involving larger samples and incorporation of randomized controlled trial methodology are underway to further elucidate the impact of this technology. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Background: Impairment in social communication is the primary deficit in school-aged children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Research has shown that there are efficacious interventions to address social communication deficits, yet their delivery is hampered by the lack of human and time resources. Emerging assistive technologies, such as smartglasses, may be able to help augment the social communication interventions currently provided by human educators and therapists. While emerging research suggests assistive socio-emotional coaching smartglasses can be effective and usable in research settings, they have yet to be studied amidst the complex social, physical, and time-constrained environment of the school classroom. This structured case study reports on the feasibility and efficacy of 16 intervention sessions of the Empowered Brain Face2Face module, a smartglasses-based social communication intervention. Methods: A 13-year-old fully-verbal adolescent male student with a diagnosis of ASD received a total of 16 smartglasses-aided intervention sessions over a 2-week period. Interventions occurred twice-daily during school days and were facilitated by school professionals in a middle school in Massachusetts, USA. Outcomes were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale 2 (SRS-2), a commonly used validated measure of social communication in children with ASD, by the participant's parent, paraprofessional, and two teachers. Difficulties in usability during the study were recorded through observation notes. Results: The participant completed the 3-week study [one pre-intervention week (baseline) and two intervention weeks] without any observations of adverse effects or usability concerns. The parent and three educators completed the SRS-2 for the baseline and intervention weeks, and results demonstrated significant improvement in social communication after the intervention relative to baseline. The parent, special education teacher, and general education teacher noted marked reductions in SRS-2 total T score, with improvement in SRS-2 social communication, social motivation, social cognition, and restricted interests and repetitive behavior subscales. Conclusion: Smartglasses are a novel assistive technology that can help facilitate social communication and behavioral coaching for students with ASD. The use of the Face2Face module by educators over a 2-week period was associated with improvements in social communication.This study supports the use of this novel technology to deliver assistive social communication and behavioral coaching in schools. © Copyright © 2018 Sahin, Abdus-Sabur, Keshav, Liu, Salisbury and Vahabzadeh.},

abstract={There is considerable demand for special education services for the over half a million students with autism in the United States. While assistive technology may augment educational services, its implementation is often prevented by a number of practical and attitudinal barriers. These barriers are especially pertinent for the newest and thus least familiar digital systems, such as computerized smartglasses loaded with specialized software modules. Computerized smartglasses are a technology that has already been shown to have an ability to deliver educational interventions through augmented reality. With this in mind, we sought to understand how school educators received and assessed the practicality of a smartglasses-based educational intervention in a single-subject study. The intervention was designed to aid with attention and social educational learning in autism. The intervention was delivered twice a day during a two-week study on a 13-year-old student with autism who was attending a mainstream middle school in Massachusetts. Three different school educators delivered the intervention: the student’s general education teacher, special education teacher, and paraprofessional. Educators recorded their attitudes, the practicality of the technology, and its impact on the student and their classroom through the use of a digital log and a series of in-person interviews. Overall, the school educators experienced a positive view of the smartglasses. The smartglasses intervention was found to be logistically practical to implement, easily usable by both the educator and student, and not time-consuming to learn or implement. Educators also identified the experience as being fun for the student, and felt that the student demonstrated improvement in his verbal and non-verbal skills. There were no adverse effects on the other students or the classroom, and the technology did not result in a distraction. These findings suggest that social skills interventions delivered by smartglasses may be practical, useful, and may lead to improvements in social communication skills. Further research on smartglasses may help to clarify the future role for augmenting special education in students with autism. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Purpose: To investigate the effectiveness of a home-based social media use intervention to enhance the social networks of rural youth with disabilities. Method: Participants were nine youth (mean age = 17.0 years) with disabilities from two rural Australian communities. The intervention consisted of providing appropriate assistive technology and social media training on individualised goals. Using mixed methods, quantitative (a single group pre-post) and qualitative (interviews with participants and their carers) measures were used to examine outcomes of training, individual experiences of the intervention, and changes to online social networks. Results: Participants increased their performance and satisfaction with performance on social media problem areas post-intervention; paired t-tests showed statistical significance at p <.001. There was also a significant increase in the number of online communication partners; Wilcoxon Signed Ranks showed statistical significance at p <.05. The interviews highlighted increased social participation, independence and improvements to literacy. Ongoing parental concerns regarding cyber safety and inappropriate online content were noted. Conclusions: The findings suggest that social media training is a feasible method for increasing social networks among rural-based youth with disabilities. To sustain ongoing benefits, parents need knowledge and training in integrating assistive technology and social media. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Social communication frequently includes nuanced nonverbal communication cues, including eye contact, gestures, facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice. This type of communication is central to face-to-face interaction, but can be challenging for children and adults with autism. Innovative technologies can provide support by augmenting human-delivered cuing and automated prompting. Specifically, immersive virtual reality (VR) offers an option to generalize social skill interventions by concretizing nonverbal information in real-time social interactions. In this work, we explore the design and evaluation of three nonverbal communication applications in immersive VR. The results of this work indicate that delivering real-time visualizations of proximity, speaker volume, and duration of one's speech is feasible in immersive VR and effective for real-time support for proximity regulation for children with autism. We conclude with design considerations for therapeutic VR systems. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Autism or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) characterizes a vast range of developmental disabilities associated with social interaction, communication and behavior. The technological evolution of smart devices and applications has created several convenient approaches to deal with such illness effectively and easily. Though basic education is a must for everyone, but teaching autism community through traditional approach is still quite complex. Similarly, ICT based learning software that has been developed for autistic kids are also facing the interaction (e.g., how autistic kids may interact with the learning software or devices) challenges. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to introduce a cost-effective, portable and user-friendly interactive learning tool to provide autistic children with basic academics. The tool consist a pressure sensing keypad to provide an easy and flexible means of interaction for autistic kids. The tool is also evaluated in a laboratory environment to assess its effectiveness and usability. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Everyday, consumer-level technologies such as mobile technologies may lend themselves to be repurposed for special needs of the populations. In this three-part study, we aimed to investigate whether the Amazon Echo™, a popular personal assistant general consumer product, can function as a speaker-independent device that permits the hands-free retrieval of visual supports for children with autism. Phase 1 investigated whether the Echo’s speaker-independent speech recognition system, linked to a proprietary Amazon “Skill,” could retrieve visual supports in order to facilitate direction following (e.g., “put the girl under the bowl”). The accuracy with which the Echo retrieved and delivered visual supports to the iPad was found to be low, suggesting that the Echo cannot function as a speaker-independent speech recognition system. Subsequently, we customized the vocabulary that was delivered to the Echo with the relevant vocabulary and repeated the protocol in phase 2. A significant increase in accuracy was noted. Finally, in phase 3, the experimenter asked the Echo to retrieve visual supports in the presence of a child with autism while monitoring correct implementation of directives based on successful retrieval by the Echo. Results will be discussed in terms of implications for future research. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={The aim of this review is to answer the following question: Does assistive technology contribute to social inclusion for people with intellectual disability? Previous research on assistive technology has focused on socioeconomic impacts such as education, employment and access to healthcare by people with intellectual disability. There is a need to consolidate evidence on the interaction between intellectual disability, assistive technology, community living and social inclusion. Methods and analysis The review will consider studies from all settings: geographical, socioeconomic and care (institutional and community care), published in English. Studies reported in other languages with abstracts in English will be included if they can be translated using Google Translate, otherwise such studies will be included in the appendix. The review will include both qualitative and quantitative studies. The intervention in this review refers to the use of assistive technology to promote community participation or interpersonal relationships (social inclusion) for people with intellectual disability. The outcomes will be behavioural and social benefits of using assistive technology by people with intellectual disability. Enhanced interpersonal relationships and community participation by people with intellectual disability. Data analysis will be in two phases. The first phase will involve analysis of individual study designs separately. The second phase will be narrative/thematic synthesis of all study groups. Ethics The review will not create any ethical or safety concerns. Dissemination At least one peer-reviewed article in a leading journal such as the BMJ is planned. The findings will also be disseminated through a seminar session involving internal audience at Trinity College Dublin and within the Assistive Technologies for people with Intellectual Disability and Autism research programme.

abstract={Humanoids as a form of assistive technologies have been shown to have positive effects on the social-cognitive behavior of brain-impaired children, particularly those with autism. However, evidences on the socio-economic benefits in social-skill training on brain-impaired children have been lacking. At the preliminary stage, a case study of a primary school with special classes for gifted children is the case study for pretesting purposes. As it is, interviewers with teachers at the special integration classes form the basis for primary data collection. Findings indicated that the teachers, parents and guardians of these children are not ready for humanoids to train their children but in future such attempts are encouraged. Nonetheless, this paper will highlight the socio-economic benefits of humanoid-assisted social skills training of children with autism. This is important in preparing them for adulthood and independence. In addition, from the literature reviewed, content analyses on humanoid-mediated research articles provide the preliminary empirical support. Evidences and outcomes from similar research projects conducted from social scientists in developing nations further narrows the objectives of the investigation. Theoretical implication from this study is also discussed. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: Computerized smartglasses are being developed as an assistive technology for daily activities in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While smartglasses may be able to help with educational and behavioral needs, their usability and acceptability in children with ASD is largely unknown. There have been reports of negative social perceptions surrounding smartglasses use in mainstream populations, a concern given that assistive technologies may already carry their own stigma. Children with ASD may also have a range of additional behavioral, developmental, and social challenges when asked to use this emerging technology in school and home settings. Objective: The usability and acceptability of Glass Enterprise Edition (Glass), the successor to Google Glass smartglasses, were explored in children with ASD and their caregivers. Methods: Eight children with ASD and their caregivers were recruited to attend a demonstration session with Glass smartglasses the week they were publicly released. The children had a wide range of ability, including limited speech to speaking, and represented a full range of school ages (6 to 17 years). Children and caregivers were interviewed about their experience of using the smartglasses and whether they would use them at school and home. Results: All 8 children succeeded in using Glass and did not feel stressed (8/8, 100%) or experience any overwhelming sensory or emotional issues during the session (8/8, 100%). All 8 children (8/8, 100%) endorsed that they would be willing to wear and use the device in both home and school settings. Caregivers felt the experience was fun for the children (8/8, 100%), and most caregivers felt the experience was better than they had expected (6/8, 75%). Conclusions: A wide age and ability range of children with ASD used Glass immediately after it was released and found it to be usable and acceptable. Despite concerns about potential stigma or social acceptability, all of the children were prepared to use the technology in both home and school settings. Encouragingly, most caregivers noted a very positive response. There were no behavioral, developmental, or social- or stigma-related concerns during or after the session. Smartglasses may be a useful future technology for children with ASD and are readily accepted for use by children with ASD and their caregivers. ©Ned T Sahin, Neha U Keshav, Joseph P Salisbury, Arshya Vahabzadeh.},

abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a pervasive developmental disorder which affects individuals with varying degrees of impairment. Children with autism have been shown to demonstrate deficits in their facial processing skills and are known to less eye contact than typically developing children. It has also been assumed that children with autism are more anxious during social interactions than typically developing children. Specifically, some studies have shown that children with autism look at the eyes as often as their peers when viewing happy faces, but those with autism tend to focus more on non-social background stimuli. Some studies have found that children with autism are not more anxious during social situations than typical children. Currently, there has been sample research done in augmented reality application for autism children. Although augmented reality is traditionally associated with software developments, developing them in the autism field involves studying the associated technology and paying attention to aspects related to interaction with augmented reality application. Augmented Reality is a technique that can bring social therapy into virtual world to increase intrinsic motivation of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Augmented reality for autism cover matters related to education, therapy for communication and social behavior enhancement. In this paper, a systematic review sets out the lines of development and research currently being conducted into augmented reality which pursue some form of benefit in the field of autism. This paper includes a literature review of relevant augmented reality developments since in year 2012 and examines new trends. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

abstract={Every human being has the right for education regardless of her or his culture, race or disability. Students with disabilities are having a challenging experience when they go through the education stages during their life. Education institutions should care about the needs of students with disabilities and try to do whatever is needed to accommodate them in the education programs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to identify the needs of students with disabilities and identify the available assistive technologies used with the various types of disabilities. Based on the results of a literature review, legal documents, and ISO standards, it was possible to identify eight needs for the students with disabilities. Furthermore, we identified the state of the art of the technologies that are internationally available and being used with five types of disabilities, i.e. deafness, blindness, dyslexia, physical disability, and autism. Benchmarking University of Sharjah's assistive technologies with best practices at other international universities enables the University of Sharjah to know where it stands with respect to other's best practices. Furthermore, they can develop the needed strategies required to adopt the best practices, which will enhance the disabled student's life in the campus. © IEOM Society International.},

abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a critical problem worldwide; however, low and middle-income countries (LMICs) often suffer more from it due to the lack of contextual research and effective care infrastructure. Moreover, ASD in LMICs offers unique challenges as cultural misperceptions and social practices often impede effective care there. However, the recent growth in mobile phone adoption in many LMICs has created a timely opportunity for improving ASD care practices through digital means. We present qualitative findings on the challenges of designing mobile assistive technologies for ASD in Bangladesh. Our data reveals a set of technical, social, and cultural challenges with caregivers and care professionals for designing a meaningful technology for them. We show how those challenges are deeply rooted in the broader infrastructural and cultural tensions of the country. We also present embedded design implications to overcome these challenges. © 2018 Upol Ehsan et al., licensed to EAI.},

abstract={Recent improvements in the field of assistive technologies have led to innovative solutions aiming at increasing the capabilities of people with disability, helping them in daily activities with applications that span from cognitive impairments to developmental disabilities. In particular, in the case of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the need to obtain active feedback in order to extract subsequently meaningful data becomes of fundamental importance. In this work, a study about the possibility of understanding the visual exploration in children with ASD is presented. In order to obtain an automatic evaluation, an algorithm for free (i.e., without constraints, nor using additional hardware, infrared (IR) light sources or other intrusive methods) gaze estimation is employed. Furthermore, no initial calibration is required. It allows the user to freely rotate the head in the field of view of the sensor, and it is insensitive to the presence of eyeglasses, hats or particular hairstyles. These relaxations of the constraints make this technique particularly suitable to be used in the critical context of autism, where the child is certainly not inclined to employ invasive devices, nor to collaborate during calibration procedures.The evaluation of children’s gaze trajectories through the proposed solution is presented for the purpose of an Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) program built on the child’s spontaneous interests and game choice delivered in a natural setting. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), who exhibit developmental limitations in social-emotional interaction and communication, are widely reported to respond positively to music therapy interventions that incorporate active and improvisational techniques. The fundamental elements of music have been shown to bypass both cognitive and language impairments to help facilitate communication skills, form social relationships and promote cognitive progression. In recent years, computer technologies such as mobile devices and interactive motion capture systems are being developed to provide new approaches to music interaction. When included into new or existing music interventions, digital technology can enhance the music playing experience and motivate children to interact differently with their environment through providing novel and engaging approaches to music interaction and creativity. This review highlights the core symptoms of ASD and presents evidence that supports the use of music therapy techniques within the autistic population, underpinned by neurological studies reporting on benefits of musical intervention. Further to this, it is explained how new technologies such as mobile devices and multi-sensory computer systems can move beyond traditional music instruments to add additional dimensions to music therapy sessions. Finally, suggestions of future research are made alongside considerations in designing new and novel auditory interventions. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Kaspar has been designed to help teachers and parents support the children in many ways. It has been used in case-study evaluation with about 170 children (long-term studies where each child interact with the robot over several weeks or months) both in schools and in families' homes. The paper presents ways in which the robot can engage autistic children in simple interactive activities and how the robot assumes the role of social mediator - encouraging children with autism to interact with other people (children and adults). Results of case study examples show how the robot may help to break the isolation, encourage the use of language, mediate child-child or child-adult interaction, help children with autism manage collaborative play, compliment the work in the classroom, provide the opportunity for basic embodied and cognitive learning, resulting in the emerging awareness of cause and effect. © Presses Universitaires de France.

abstract={Barriers to accessibility are defined as ‘factors in a person’s environment that, through their absence or presence, limit functioning and create disability’ [1]. There are four elements that are incorporated into this term which includes: physical environment, lack of assistive technology, attitudes of others and the lack of or restrictive services, systems and policies [1]. These barriers to accessibility are present for 13% of the Irish population. Many initiatives have been developed and implemented for people with physical disabilities; however, people with intellectual disabilities (ID) remain invisible. This invisible population accounts for 9.7% of our population or 75% of the population of people with disabilities [2]. Thus, it is imperative that we commence to implement Universal Design (UD) approaches that increase accessibility and empower the invisible to become visible. One such invisible group that holds substantial potential to bring immense value to companies is that of people with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) [3]. ASD currently impacts 1 in 68 people worldwide with this figure growing annually at a rate of 10-17% [4]. 80% of people with ASD are either unemployed or underemployed; this can be attributed to barriers to accessibility [5]. Two of the most common barriers to accessibility experienced by those with ASD are environmental and attitudes of others [6,7]. These barriers have the potential to be overcome through the use of Virtual Reality (VR) technology to provide training and education to managers. VR technology is being used to empower managers to reduce these barriers, increase accessibility and develop inclusive environments and cultures. VR technology can be used to empower managers to recognise and reduce the barriers facing those with ASD. VR is a catalyst for managers to be able to identify the environmental barriers facing people with ASD within a work environment. This solution also provides them with the skills necessary to commence making adaptations to the environment to reduce or eliminate these barriers. The use of this technology and paradigm shift brings many benefits for the individual and the company. A mixed method approach has been used for the purposes of data collection. The tools that were utilised were interviews with HR managers and people with ASD; and surveys were circulated to HR managers, senior managers, Chief Executive Officers and people with ASD. The results of these were positive and clearly verified that there is a need to empower managers to increase accessibility within their organisations. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={Background: "Communication Stories" provide individualized, electronic examples of how transition-aged students communicate. Intended to promote self-advocacy and improved workplace interactions, they are created and shared by students with supervisors about the specific communication strategies they use. Objective: This pilot study evaluated the perceived impact of Communication Stories on participants, their job coaches, and workplace supervisors using a combination of quantitative/qualitative methods. Methods: Using their personal iDevices, stories were created with input from nine participants with intellectual disabilities and/or autism and concomitant language impairments. Job coaches self-assessed their knowledge of participants' communication strategies before and after viewing the stories, and job coaches and workplace supervisors were interviewed about the perceived impact of the stories on workplace interactions. Results: Following viewing of stories, job coaches reported significant increases in knowledge of participants' communication strategies and confidence supporting their workplace communication. Stakeholder feedback also revealed themes including: (1) participants' "taking charge" of sharing their stories appeared to strengthen their self-esteem and relationships with their supervisors, and (2) viewing stories appeared to have a positive impact on the communication behaviors of job coaches and workplace supervisors. Conclusions: Stakeholders, including participants and their families, were very enthusiastic about Communication Stories and recommended their expanded use across settings and conversation partners. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to neurodevelopmental problems characterized by difficulties in social interaction, especially verbal or nonverbal communication. Research on ASD focuses in finding appropriate solutions for a patient, using all available resources (virtual interfaces, virtual reality, 3D environments, robotics, etc.) in order to develop therapeutic strategies. Therefore, the use of technologies to improve and stimulate communication, particularly in children with ASD, has increased exponentially in recent years. When used in therapeutic contexts, these tools allow a generalization of a child’s behavior towards a natural context. Hence, the use of customized softwares for mobile devices will allow progress in treating ASD beyond a clinical setting and may be used at home/school to communicate with their close social peers. © 2017 by Sociedad Chilena de Psicología Clínica.},

abstract={Overselectivity is a learning challenge that is largely unaddressed in the assistive technology community. Screening and intervention, done by specialists, is time-intensive and requires substantial training. Little to no treatments are available to the broader population of preliterate, minimally verbal individuals. In this work, we examine the impact of an iPad game based on the tenets of behavioral therapy to mitigate overselectivity. We developed software-based techniques and evaluated the system using established methods from the field of Special Education. We present the results of a deployment in a special education school that demonstrates that an assistive tablet game is a feasible means of addressing overselectivity, and we present generalizable technological features drawn from evidenced-based therapies to consider in future assistive technologies. We suggest that designers of assistive technology systems, particularly those who address physical, cognitive, and behavioral difficulties for preliterate AAC users, should consider overselectivity as a potential co-occurring condition. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Background: Augmented reality (AR) smartglasses are an emerging technology that is under investigation as a social communication aid for children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and as a research tool to aid with digital phenotyping. Tolerability of this wearable technology in people with ASD is an important area for research, especially as these individuals may experience sensory, cognitive, and attentional challenges. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the tolerability and usability of a novel smartglasses system that has been designed as a social communication aid for children and adults with autism (the Brain Power Autism System [BPAS]). BPAS runs on Google Glass Explorer Edition and other smartglasses, uses both AR and affective artificial intelligence, and helps users learn key social and emotional skills. Methods: A total of 21 children and adults with ASD across a spectrum of severity used BPAS for a coaching session. The user’s tolerability to the smartglasses, user being able to wear the smartglasses for 1 minute (initial tolerability threshold), and user being able to wear the smartglasses for the entire duration of the coaching session (whole session tolerability threshold) were determined through caregiver report. Results: Of 21 users, 19 (91%) demonstrated tolerability on all 3 measures. Caregivers reported 21 out of 21 users (100%) as tolerating the experience, while study staff found only 19 out of 21 users managed to demonstrate initial tolerability (91%). Of the 19 users who demonstrated initial tolerability, all 19 (100%) were able to use the smartglasses for the entire session (whole session tolerability threshold). Caregivers reported that 19 out of 21 users (91%) successfully used BPAS, and users surpassed caregiver expectations in 15 of 21 cases (71%). Users who could communicate reported BPAS as being comfortable (94%). Conclusions: This preliminary report suggests that BPAS is well tolerated and usable to a diverse age-and severity-range of people with ASD. This is encouraging as these devices are being developed as assistive technologies for people with ASD. Further research should focus on improving smartglasses design and exploring their efficacy in helping with social communication in children and adults with ASD. © Neha U. Keshav, Joseph P.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the extent and type of robots used for the rehabilitation and education of children and young people with CP and ASD and the associated outcomes. Methods: The scholarly literature was systematically searched and analyzed. Articles were included if they reported the results of robots used or intended to be used for the rehabilitation and education of children and young people with CP and ASD during play and educative and social interaction activities. Results: We found 15 robotic systems reported in 34 studies that provided a low level of evidence. The outcomes were mainly for children with ASD interaction and who had a reduction in autistic behaviour, and for CP cognitive development, learning, and play. Conclusion: More research is needed in this area using designs that provide higher validity. A centred design approach is needed for developing new low-cost robots for this population. Implications for rehabilitation In spite of the potential of robots to promote development in children with ASD and CP, the limited available evidence requires researchers to conduct studies with higher validity. The low level of evidence plus the need for specialized technical support should be considered critical factors before making the decision to purchase robots for use in treatment for children with CP and ASD. A user-entered design approach would increase the chances of success for robots to improve functional, learning, and educative outcomes in children with ASD and CP. We recommend that developers use this approach. The participation of interdisciplinary teams in the design, development, and implementation of new robotic systems is of extra value. We recommend the design and development of low-cost robotic systems to make robots more affordable. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

We argue the potential of recent widespread wearables, and more specifically smartwatches, to achieve this goal. Then, a smartwatch system that implements a wide range of selfregulation strategies and infers outburst patterns from physiological signals and movement is presented, along with an authoring tool for smartphones that is to be used by caregivers or family members to create and edit these strategies, in an adaptive way. We conducted an intensive experiment with two individuals with ASD who showed varied, representative behavioral responses to their emotional dysregulation. Both users were able to employ effective, customized emotional self‐regulation strategies by means of the system, recovering from the majority of mild stress episodes and temper tantrums experienced in the nine days of experiment in their classroom. © 2017 by the authors.

Representation of music has taken many forms over time, from musical notation [16], through to random algorithm-based visualisations based on the amplitude of an audio signal [19]. One aspect of music visualisation that has not been widely explored is that of Cymatics. Cymatics are physical impressions of music created in mediums such as water. Current Cymatic visualisations are restricted to 2D imaging, whilst 3D visualisations of music are generally based on arbitrary mapping of audio-visual attributes.

abstract={It has been suggested that computer-assisted instruction (CAI) is a promising method for educating students on the autism spectrum. We aimed to determine whether automated recognition of facial expressions aided in predicting CAI engagement and learning performance. Seven youth with autism (mean age = 12.7, SD = 4.2) interacted with a CAI program, TeachTown Basics, for 15 consecutive sessions. Video recordings of the participants' faces were collected during these sessions and facial expressions from these videos were analyzed using CERT, an algorithm that automatically outputs intensity values for each facial action unit (AU). Using these data, we attempted to operationally define two engagement indices: (1) behavioral engagement, the proportion of time a participant had their face oriented to the computer screen; and (2) emotional engagement, the activation of AUs previously associated with CAI. Our results suggest that both indices strongly correlated with one another, but that emotional (not behavioral) engagement predicted test performance. CAI knowledge domain, participant sex, and developmental age also contributed to the prediction. Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Deploying novel technologies requires the coordinated efforts of the research team, research participants, and a variety of community members and project stakeholders. To ensure that the project is completed successfully, these disparate groups of people engage in articulation work, which is the meta-work that supports the use of collaborative systems. In this paper, we examine the articulation work surrounding the deployment of systems that have found limited long-term adoption: assistive technology. Specifically, we examine three research deployments of a collaborative game for children with autism. Analysis of the articulation work performed during these studies demonstrates how research deployments of technologies create conditions in which stakeholders must take on additional roles to make the deployment work. By understanding the articulation work surrounding deployment studies engendered in this role fluidity, we can improve both research design and the analysis of data emergent from these studies. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={People with autism are at risk for social isolation due to differences in their perception and engagement with the social world. In this work, we aim to address one specific concern related to socialization - the understanding, awareness, and use of interpersonal space. Over the course of a year, we iteratively designed and tested a series of concepts for supporting children with autism in perceiving, understanding, and responding to physical proximity with other people. During this process, we developed ProCom, a prototype system for measuring proximity without requiring instrumentation of the environment or another person. We used a variety of low and high fidelity prototypes, culminating in ProCom, to assess the feasibility, utility, and challenges of this approach. The results of these iterative design engagements indicate that wearable assistive technologies can support people in developing awareness of physical proximity in social settings. However, challenges related to both personal and collective use remain. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Assistive Technology (AT) revolutionized the process of learning for special needs students during the past three decades. Thanks to this technology, accessibility and educational inclusion became attainable more than any time in the history of special education. Meanwhile, assistive technology devices remain unreachable for a large number of students with disabilities, especially in under-developed and developing countries like Morocco due to a number of factors, especially, availability and affordability. Mobile learning, using smartphones and tablets in particular, may provide alternative solutions as special education tools in such countries. Additionally, open source platforms, particularly Google play store with all the applications it accommodates for disabled people, may obviate the need for monofunctional, sometimes expensive, AT devices. The present paper sets out to investigate potentials of using smartphones and tablets as alternative learning tools for assistive technology devices within formal and informal learning environments. It compares seven free Google Play medical apps with seven assistive technology devices at the level of functionality and affordability. The apps are of relevance to cases of physical as well as mental disabilities, namely hearing impairment, visual impairment, autism and speech articulation disorders. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The face embodies a large portion of the human emotionally expressive behaviour. Moreover, facial expressions are used to display emotional states and to manage interactions, being one of the most important channels of non-verbal communication. Although the process of recognition and displaying emotions is an easy task for the majority of humans, it is a very difficult task for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The present paper is a summary of a work developed under a Master Thesis on Industrial Electronics Engineering and Computers from the University of Minho, Portugal. The main goal of the work was the development and application of interactive and assistive technologies to support and promote new adaptive teaching/learning approaches for children with ASD. Therefore, it was proposed a system that uses the recent Intel RealSense 3D sensor to promote imitation and recognition of facial expressions, using a RoboKind Zeno R50 robot (ZECA) as a mediator in social activities. The system was first validated in the research laboratory and then tested in school environment with typically developing children and children with ASD. © 2017 IEEE.},

We reflected in an iterative way on how the designs evolved, and on how our theoretical lens, grounded in embodied theory, helped to shape the designs. In the final round of reflection, we compared both case studies, looking for overall commonalities, which formed the basis for the resulting design framework that we introduce in this paper. The framework consists of seven principles, of which three support embodied activity in the here-And-now, three support developmental processes over a longer time-scale, and finally the idea of a reflective process to connect them. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Today, we find many children with difficulties in dealing with physical and mental tasks. Technology promotes welfare of the differently abled children along with bringing social justice to them on humanitarian grounds. Assistive devices with sensor technology are the humanitarian technologies which are essentially required for the differently abled children. They can have a better life if they are provided with assistive devices with sensor technology i.e., assistive technology. Technology has a great impact on the differently abled child's life as the child becomes independent in performing his day to day activities. The parents of differently abled children expect that there should not be any socio-psychological restrictions to their child. Disability of the child can have less impact on the development of the child and even their family if the child can perform the activities independently which can be achieved with the help of assistive technologies. Assistive technology not only helps the differently abled children to lead a normal life but also helps the children to overcome their disability and get educated. In India, statistics reveal that differently abled children are more in rural areas than in urban areas. The main reason for this situation is unavailability of good pediatrician and gynecologist. Differently abled children in rural areas are discriminated. Some of these children are even abandoned during childhood. The reason being, such parents are not educated, they have low socio economic background and lack of knowledge in latest technologies. Technology has opened plethora of opportunities for assisting differently abled children. This paper mainly focuses on providing the information of the assistive devices with low cost sensor technology which are helpful for the (i) Autistic children (ii) Children with visual impairment and Dyslexia and (iii) Physically challenged children. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Impairments in social communication skills and deficient social and emotional competence are thought to be core deficits in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In recent years, several assistive technologies, particularly virtual reality (VR), have been proposed as therapeutic devices that promote social interactions in autism. Furthermore, the application of psychophysiological monitoring during VR exposure captures real-time response to VR interaction allowing customized assessment of emotional reactivity, social competence, and social skills. Subjective reports, parental and clinicians’ evaluations, behavioral performance scores, and psychophysiological monitoring can be effectively used to document the effects of VR within a realistic and dynamic threedimensional (3D) context matched to the specifics of autism research queries. We propose that the integration of VR and applied psychophysiology methods holds the promise of enhancing social and emotional competence in autism. The major objective of the review is to consider a strong rationale to assess emotional reactivity, social competence, and joint attention in high-functioning children with ASD during exposure to a VR environment with concurrent psychophysiological monitoring. Furthermore, the chapter aims to examine whether there are possible ways to develop VR-based methods of training emotional reactivity, social skills, and joint attention initiation and responsiveness in individuals with ASD. The application of VR and psychophysiology monitoring- based emotional and social skills assessment and potentially also social skills training courses may significantly improve the generalization of acquired skills. The application of psychophysiology-informed VR systems could be adjusted for use not only in laboratory settings but also in more natural settings such as outpatient clinics and school and home settings. An additional important component of the innovation of the proposed line of research is that VR with concurrent real-time psychophysiological monitoring can be converted into a far more advanced novel solution where VR scenarios might be modified using physiological activity inputs, that is, operate in biofeedback mode. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The purpose of this article is to understand and document the level and quality of assistive technology (AT) driven rehabilitative support offered to people with impairments within Finland. Availability, accessibility and adoption of assistive technologies are of interest to this study. Currently public institutions, such as city hospitals and national social security institution, offer AT services generally on the basis of age, employment and individual needs. The main research question is, how people with impairments and their relatives perceive assistive technology delivery, use as well as continued adoption? Based on data, the different aspects of AT service delivery model and its relationship to rehabilitation process are described. The empirical data is gathered through interviews and official documents including appropriate laws and guidelines published by public institutions. Analysis of the data highlights stages within the current system where negative experiences create distrust and dissatisfaction among AT adopters. These experiences are categorized to themes and stages which may be used for analyzing AT services and its relation to rehabilitation in future research. Further research would be needed to compare the applicability of the defined stages in analyzing delivering AT services in other countries – both similar and different to Finland. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.},

abstract={Objectives: Everyday technologies (e.g. iPads, smart phones, Apple Watch®) might be successfully repurposed to meet the needs of children with disabilities. Although visual supports are an empirically supported treatment, they are typically not provided just-in-time (JIT). In this study, we aimed to provide JIT visual supports in the form of scene cues (representative photos or video clips) to augment spoken input to children with a dual diagnosis of intellectual disability and autism. The objectives of this study were to (a) explore whether JIT-delivered scene cues permit these children to implement directives they were unable to complete with speech alone, and (b) test the feasibility of providing scene cues on the Apple Watch® with a focus on display size. Methods: Using a case series design, five children with an intellectual disability and autism were presented with directives and required to carry out the directives with figurines and objects as a table top activity. Initially, each directive was presented in spoken form only, and static scene cues (photos) and subsequently dynamic scene cues (video clips) were provided as augmented input as needed (JIT). Results: The hierarchical JIT visual supports enabled the five children with intellectual disability and autism to carry out the majority of directives. Conclusions: The relatively small display size of the Apple Watch does not seem to hinder children with a dual diagnosis of intellectual disability and autism to glean critical information from visual supports. The JIT provision of scene cues resulted in successful directive-following in these children. © The British Society of Developmental Disabilities 2017.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities struggle to find integrated employment because of their challenges with vocational task acquisition and completion. Video-based self-directed prompts have been utilized on iPads, smartphones, and personal digital assistants (PDA's) to overcome this challenge in acquiring and completing vocational tasks in integrated community-based employment settings. OBJECTIVE: In this study, self-directed video prompting on iPads was used with three male participants with intellectual and developmental disabilities in integrated community-based employment settings. METHODS: A multiple probe across tasks design was used to determine the effects of the intervention on the acquisition and accurate completion of vocational tasks in integrated employment settings. Prior to intervention with self-directed video prompting in the integrated employment setting, a multiple probe across participants design was used to determine the effects of a training package for teaching iPad usage consisting of modeling and least-to-most prompting on a training task. RESULTS: All three participants acquired device usage in two to five trials. The participants all acquired three vocational tasks in the course of the study and demonstrated generalization to new materials, settings, or people in two of their three tasks. CONCLUSION: Video-based self-directed prompts promote improved performance in integrated community-based employment settings. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

This systematic review investigates the effectiveness of evidence-based interventions to increase employment for people with various disabilities. Forty-six articles met the inclusion criteria for evidence-based interventions. The majority of studies assessed interventions for persons with mental health disabilities. Strong evidence was found for ongoing support and work-related social skills training prior to and during competitive employment for persons with mental health disabilities. Moderate evidence supported simulation and use of assistive technology, especially apps for cueing and peer support to increase work participation for persons with intellectual disabilities, neurological/cognitive disabilities, and autism spectrum disorder. Many of the strategies to increase work participation were appropriate for occupational therapy intervention. Suggestions were made for research, specifically looking at more rigorous evaluation of strategies in the long term. © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Autism spectrum disorder is becoming a global challenge as the number of children affected by it increases drastically. Autistic children suffer from impairments such as social interactions, language and communication skills, cognitive skills and psychomotor skills. A number of technological systems have been put to use for training children with autism. The children’s attraction towards robot and robot like features promotes the use of assistive technology in rehabilitating autistic children. This paper focuses on teaching psychomotor skills to autistic children by employing a robotic training kit. The scope of the training includes learning the concept of directions and the ability to operate a joystick so as to manipulate the robot as per given instructions. Training and trials were conducted under the supervision of a speech therapist. The study demonstrated the positive response of employing the robotic kit in imparting the knowledge of directions, hand–eye coordination and palmar grasp. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},
